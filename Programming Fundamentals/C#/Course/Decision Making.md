In C#, **decision-making** structures allow the program to choose between different actions based on conditions. The most common decision-making structures are the **if statement**, **switch statement**, and **ternary operator**. These structures allow for conditional execution of code, enabling programs to make decisions dynamically during runtime.

### 1. **if Statement**
The `if` statement is the most basic decision-making structure in C#. It allows you to execute a block of code if a condition evaluates to `true`. If the condition is `false`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

#### Example:
```csharp
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are an adult.");
}
```

### 2. **if-else Statement**
The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block of code that executes if the condition evaluates to `false`.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
else
{
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

#### Example:
```csharp
int age = 16;

if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are an adult.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are a minor.");
}
```

### 3. **if-else if-else Statement**
The `if-else if-else` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. If one condition is `true`, that block of code is executed; otherwise, the program checks the next condition.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    // code to execute if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2)
{
    // code to execute if condition2 is true
}
else
{
    // code to execute if none of the conditions are true
}
```

#### Example:
```csharp
int score = 85;

if (score >= 90)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade A");
}
else if (score >= 80)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade B");
}
else if (score >= 70)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade C");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade F");
}
```

### 4. **Nested if Statements**
You can also nest `if` statements inside each other, creating more complex conditions. This is known as a **nested if**.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    if (condition2)
    {
        // code to execute if both conditions are true
    }
}
```

#### Example:
```csharp
int age = 20;
bool hasPermission = true;

if (age >= 18)
{
    if (hasPermission)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You can access the content.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You do not have permission.");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are underage.");
}
```

### 5. **switch Statement**
The `switch` statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check against a single variable. It is often more readable than using a series of `if-else if` statements when checking for multiple values of the same variable.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
switch (expression)
{
    case value1:
        // code to execute if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to execute if expression equals value2
        break;
    default:
        // code to execute if expression does not match any case
        break;
}
```

#### Example:
```csharp
int dayOfWeek = 3;

switch (dayOfWeek)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        Console.WriteLine("Thursday");
        break;
    case 5:
        Console.WriteLine("Friday");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Weekend");
        break;
}
```

In this example, if `dayOfWeek` equals `3`, the output will be `"Wednesday"`. If the value does not match any case, the `default` block is executed.

### 6. **switch Expression (C# 8.0 and later)**
Starting from C# 8.0, the `switch` statement was enhanced with a new **switch expression**. This provides a more concise and functional way of writing switch statements.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
var result = expression switch
{
    value1 => result1,
    value2 => result2,
    _ => defaultResult
};
```

#### Example:
```csharp
int dayOfWeek = 3;

var dayName = dayOfWeek switch
{
    1 => "Monday",
    2 => "Tuesday",
    3 => "Wednesday",
    4 => "Thursday",
    5 => "Friday",
    _ => "Weekend"
};

Console.WriteLine(dayName);  // Output: Wednesday
```

In this case, the switch expression evaluates `dayOfWeek` and assigns a corresponding string to `dayName`.

### 7. **Ternary Operator**
The **ternary operator** (`?:`) is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement. It is often used for simple conditions where you need to return one of two values.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

#### Example:
```csharp
int age = 18;
string status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
Console.WriteLine(status);  // Output: Adult
```

### 8. **Null-Coalescing Operator**
The **null-coalescing operator** (`??`) is used to provide a default value when an expression is `null`.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
var result = value ?? defaultValue;
```

#### Example:
```csharp
string name = null;
string displayName = name ?? "Guest";  // If name is null, use "Guest"
Console.WriteLine(displayName);  // Output: Guest
```

### 9. **Short-Circuiting in Logical Operators**
In logical operations, the **AND** (`&&`) and **OR** (`||`) operators use **short-circuiting** behavior. This means that if the result can be determined from the first condition, the second condition is not evaluated.

- **AND (`&&`)**: If the first condition is `false`, the overall result is `false`, so the second condition is not evaluated.
- **OR (`||`)**: If the first condition is `true`, the overall result is `true`, so the second condition is not evaluated.

#### Example:
```csharp
int a = 5, b = 10;

if (a > 3 && b < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will not execute.");
}

if (a > 3 || b < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will execute.");
}
```

In the first `if` statement, the second condition (`b < 5`) is not evaluated because the first condition (`a > 3`) is `false` and the result of the `&&` operator will already be `false`. In the second `if` statement, the first condition (`a > 3`) is `true`, so the second condition (`b < 5`) is not evaluated.

### Summary of Decision-Making Structures:
- **`if`**: Executes code based on a condition.
- **`if-else`**: Executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if false.
- **`if-else if-else`**: Checks multiple conditions in sequence.
- **`switch`**: Checks a variable against multiple possible values and executes the corresponding block of code.
- **`switch expression`**: A more concise version of the `switch` statement introduced in C# 8.0.
- **Ternary operator** (`?:`): A shorthand for `if-else` when you need to assign one of two values.
- **Null-coalescing operator** (`??`): Provides a default value if the expression is `null`.

Each of these decision-making structures can be used depending on the complexity and nature of the decision-making required in your program.
