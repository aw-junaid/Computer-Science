### **Rogue Access Points**

A **rogue access point (AP)** is an unauthorized wireless access point that is connected to a network, often without the knowledge or consent of the network administrators. These access points can be deliberately set up by attackers with malicious intent or unintentionally installed by employees who may not be aware of the security risks.

Rogue access points pose significant security threats because they create vulnerabilities in a network, allowing unauthorized access, eavesdropping, and potential data breaches. They can bypass network security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems, especially if they are not properly detected and mitigated.

### **Types of Rogue Access Points**

1. **Malicious Rogue APs (Evil Twin)**:
   - These are rogue access points set up intentionally by attackers to deceive legitimate users into connecting to them. The attacker typically configures the rogue AP to mimic a legitimate network, often with the same SSID (Service Set Identifier).
   - Once users connect to the rogue AP, the attacker can intercept sensitive information such as passwords, emails, or credit card numbers, or even launch further attacks on the users' devices.
   - **Example**: An attacker sets up a rogue AP in a coffee shop and uses the same SSID as the legitimate public Wi-Fi network. Users unknowingly connect to the rogue AP, and their sensitive data is captured.

2. **Unintentional Rogue APs**:
   - These rogue APs are typically set up without malicious intent. Employees or users might install personal wireless routers or access points to extend the network’s coverage or to access resources more conveniently, without realizing the risks.
   - **Example**: An employee connects a personal Wi-Fi router to the corporate network for better connectivity, not knowing that doing so creates a potential entry point for attackers.

3. **Misconfigured Rogue APs**:
   - Sometimes, access points that are intended to be part of a network may be misconfigured, leading them to operate outside of the organization's network security policies. These APs may inadvertently expose the network to security risks.
   - **Example**: A legitimate access point in a conference room might be misconfigured to allow unauthorized devices to connect or broadcast sensitive internal SSIDs.

### **Security Risks of Rogue Access Points**

1. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - Rogue APs bypass the organization's access controls, allowing unauthorized devices to join the network. Once connected, an attacker can exploit the access point to launch further attacks, like data exfiltration or network reconnaissance.

2. **Data Interception and Eavesdropping**:
   - Malicious rogue APs (Evil Twin) can intercept network traffic from devices that connect to them. This allows attackers to capture sensitive information such as login credentials, emails, and other personal data.

3. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM)**:
   - Once a victim device connects to a rogue access point, the attacker can position themselves between the victim and the network. This allows the attacker to monitor and potentially alter communications between the device and the legitimate network.

4. **Network Breaches and Malware Distribution**:
   - A rogue AP may serve as an entry point for malware or ransomware, allowing attackers to infect devices that connect to the rogue network. Once compromised, attackers can exploit the infected devices to launch further attacks against the organization.

5. **Bypassing Network Security**:
   - If security measures like firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not properly configured to monitor all access points, a rogue AP can allow attackers to bypass these defenses, leading to undetected security breaches.

### **How Rogue Access Points are Detected**

1. **Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS)**:
   - WIDS are specialized tools designed to detect unauthorized wireless devices or access points. They monitor the radio spectrum for rogue APs that are operating outside of the network’s established configuration.
   - These systems typically detect anomalies such as mismatched SSIDs, weak encryption settings, or unexpected AP locations, which may indicate a rogue AP.

2. **Network Scanning and Monitoring**:
   - Network administrators can use network scanners to identify all connected devices and access points on the network. Tools like **Wireshark**, **Kismet**, and **NetSpot** can help scan for rogue APs by identifying unusual traffic or unapproved devices on the network.

3. **SSID Mapping and Monitoring**:
   - Regularly mapping and monitoring SSIDs in the network can help detect rogue access points. Administrators can check for SSIDs that don’t match the organization’s approved list or for devices that are broadcasting SSIDs that are not expected.

4. **MAC Address Filtering**:
   - Administrators can monitor the MAC addresses of access points in the network and compare them to a whitelist of authorized devices. If any device appears with a MAC address that is not on the whitelist, it could be a rogue access point.

5. **Physical Site Surveys**:
   - Physical site surveys, where network administrators conduct on-site checks for unauthorized APs, can help detect rogue APs, especially in areas with limited wireless coverage or in environments with large open spaces.

### **Preventing Rogue Access Points**

1. **Network Segmentation**:
   - Segmenting the network can help reduce the potential damage that rogue access points can cause. For example, separating guest networks from internal networks can limit the scope of unauthorized access and attacks.

2. **Strong Authentication and Encryption**:
   - Implement strong WPA3 encryption for wireless networks and enforce the use of robust authentication methods (such as 802.1X). This prevents attackers from easily connecting to rogue APs or intercepting data.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Implement strict access control policies, such as MAC address filtering, to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. Only known and trusted devices should be allowed to connect.

4. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct regular audits of the network’s wireless infrastructure. This includes verifying the configuration of wireless access points and ensuring they adhere to security policies.

5. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Educate employees and users about the risks of rogue APs and encourage them not to set up personal access points without approval. Raising awareness about network security can reduce the likelihood of accidental rogue AP installations.

6. **Disable Unused Ports**:
   - Disabling unused Ethernet ports and restricting the ability to plug in unauthorized devices can prevent rogue access points from being connected directly to the network.

7. **Monitoring Network Traffic**:
   - Continuously monitor network traffic for signs of unauthorized wireless traffic. Unusual traffic patterns or unknown devices connecting to the network can indicate a rogue AP is present.

### **Conclusion**

Rogue access points represent a serious security risk in any wireless network. Whether installed with malicious intent or due to negligence, rogue APs can expose an organization to unauthorized access, data theft, and attacks. Detection and prevention of rogue access points require a combination of robust network monitoring, employee education, and strict network access control measures. By implementing these practices, organizations can minimize the impact of rogue APs and maintain a secure wireless environment.
