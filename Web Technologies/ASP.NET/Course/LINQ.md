### ASP.NET - LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

**LINQ (Language Integrated Query)** is a powerful feature in .NET that allows developers to query and manipulate data directly in C# (or other .NET languages) using a SQL-like syntax. LINQ provides a unified approach to querying different data sources, such as arrays, collections, databases, XML, and more, in a concise and readable manner.

LINQ integrates query capabilities into the language, making it easier to work with data in various formats without requiring additional APIs or complex syntax.

### Key Concepts of LINQ in ASP.NET

1. **LINQ to Objects**
2. **LINQ to SQL**
3. **LINQ to Entities (Entity Framework)**
4. **LINQ to XML**
5. **LINQ Query Syntax vs. Method Syntax**
6. **Deferred vs. Immediate Execution**
7. **Common LINQ Operations**
8. **LINQ in ASP.NET MVC and Web API**

### 1. **LINQ to Objects**

**LINQ to Objects** allows you to query in-memory collections such as arrays, lists, and other data structures that implement `IEnumerable<T>`. This is the simplest form of LINQ, which can be used to filter, sort, and manipulate data in memory.

#### Example of LINQ to Objects:
```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

// Query using LINQ to filter even numbers
var evenNumbers = from n in numbers
                  where n % 2 == 0
                  select n;

foreach (var num in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);  // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
}
```

In this example, LINQ is used to filter out even numbers from a list of integers.

### 2. **LINQ to SQL**

**LINQ to SQL** allows you to query and manipulate data in a SQL Server database using LINQ syntax. It maps database tables to .NET classes and allows you to write queries in C# rather than writing raw SQL.

#### Example of LINQ to SQL:
```csharp
using (var context = new MyDataContext())
{
    // Query to get all employees with salary greater than 50000
    var highEarners = from emp in context.Employees
                      where emp.Salary > 50000
                      select emp;

    foreach (var employee in highEarners)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(employee.Name + " - " + employee.Salary);
    }
}
```

In this example, LINQ is used to query the `Employees` table from a SQL Server database and filter employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

- The `MyDataContext` class is auto-generated by LINQ to SQL and provides a strongly typed representation of the database.
- The query is translated into SQL and executed against the database.

---

### 3. **LINQ to Entities (Entity Framework)**

**LINQ to Entities** is part of the **Entity Framework** (EF), which is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers to query and manipulate data from relational databases using LINQ. LINQ to Entities is similar to LINQ to SQL but works with the Entity Framework, which supports more complex scenarios like lazy loading, change tracking, and complex relationships.

#### Example of LINQ to Entities:
```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    // Query to get products with price greater than 100
    var expensiveProducts = from product in context.Products
                            where product.Price > 100
                            select product;

    foreach (var product in expensiveProducts)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(product.Name + " - " + product.Price);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `MyDbContext` is the `DbContext` that represents the database.
- The `Products` table is mapped to the `Product` entity class.

LINQ to Entities queries are translated into SQL by Entity Framework.

---

### 4. **LINQ to XML**

**LINQ to XML** allows you to query and manipulate XML data using LINQ. This is especially useful for working with XML documents in a more natural and declarative way, compared to traditional XML APIs.

#### Example of LINQ to XML:
```csharp
XDocument doc = XDocument.Load("books.xml");

var books = from book in doc.Descendants("book")
            where (int)book.Element("price") > 50
            select new
            {
                Title = book.Element("title").Value,
                Price = book.Element("price").Value
            };

foreach (var book in books)
{
    Console.WriteLine(book.Title + " - " + book.Price);
}
```

In this example:
- `XDocument` loads an XML file.
- LINQ is used to filter books with a price greater than 50.

LINQ to XML provides an intuitive and easy-to-use API for querying and modifying XML documents.

### 5. **LINQ Query Syntax vs. Method Syntax**

LINQ can be written in two main syntaxes:
1. **Query Syntax**: Similar to SQL and uses the `from`, `where`, `select` keywords.
2. **Method Syntax**: Uses LINQ extension methods like `Where()`, `Select()`, `OrderBy()`, etc.

#### Example of Query Syntax:
```csharp
var highEarners = from emp in context.Employees
                  where emp.Salary > 50000
                  select emp;
```

#### Example of Method Syntax:
```csharp
var highEarners = context.Employees
                         .Where(emp => emp.Salary > 50000)
                         .Select(emp => emp);
```

Both syntaxes are functionally equivalent, and you can mix and match them in the same query.

### 6. **Deferred vs. Immediate Execution**

- **Deferred Execution**: LINQ queries are not executed when they are defined; instead, the query is executed when the results are enumerated (e.g., in a `foreach` loop). This allows for efficient querying by not fetching the data until it is actually needed.

  ```csharp
  var query = from emp in context.Employees
              where emp.Salary > 50000
              select emp;
  
  // Query is not executed yet

  foreach (var employee in query)
  {
      Console.WriteLine(employee.Name);
  }
  ```

- **Immediate Execution**: Some LINQ methods like `ToList()`, `ToArray()`, and `Count()` execute the query immediately and return the result.

  ```csharp
  var highEarnersList = query.ToList();  // Executes the query immediately
  ```

---

### 7. **Common LINQ Operations**

Here are some of the most common LINQ methods:

- **Filtering**: `Where()`
  ```csharp
  var highEarners = context.Employees.Where(emp => emp.Salary > 50000);
  ```

- **Projection**: `Select()`
  ```csharp
  var employeeNames = context.Employees.Select(emp => emp.Name);
  ```

- **Ordering**: `OrderBy()`, `OrderByDescending()`
  ```csharp
  var orderedEmployees = context.Employees.OrderBy(emp => emp.Name);
  ```

- **Grouping**: `GroupBy()`
  ```csharp
  var groups = context.Employees.GroupBy(emp => emp.Department);
  ```

- **Aggregation**: `Sum()`, `Average()`, `Count()`
  ```csharp
  var totalSalary = context.Employees.Sum(emp => emp.Salary);
  ```

- **Joining**: `Join()`
  ```csharp
  var query = from emp in context.Employees
              join dep in context.Departments
              on emp.DepartmentId equals dep.Id
              select new { emp.Name, dep.Name };
  ```

### 8. **LINQ in ASP.NET MVC and Web API**

LINQ is often used in ASP.NET MVC and Web API applications to query data from databases and return the results to the client.

#### Example of LINQ in ASP.NET MVC:
```csharp
public ActionResult Employees()
{
    var employees = from emp in db.Employees
                    where emp.Salary > 50000
                    select emp;

    return View(employees.ToList());
}
```

In this example, the `Employees` action queries the database to fetch employees with a salary greater than 50,000 and returns the result to a view.

#### Example of LINQ in ASP.NET Web API:
```csharp
public IHttpActionResult GetEmployees()
{
    var employees = from emp in db.Employees
                    where emp.Salary > 50000
                    select emp;

    return Ok(employees.ToList());
}
```

In this example, the `GetEmployees` method of a Web API controller uses LINQ to query the database and returns the result as a JSON response to the client.
