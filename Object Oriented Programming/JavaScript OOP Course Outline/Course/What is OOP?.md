Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes and models software using objects. Objects represent real-world entities and encapsulate data (properties) and behavior (methods) in a single, reusable structure. 

### **Key Concepts of OOP**
1. **Encapsulation**  
   - Combining data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (object).  
   - Example: A `Car` object with properties like `color` and methods like `drive()`.

2. **Inheritance**  
   - Creating new classes (child classes) that derive properties and behaviors from existing classes (parent classes).  
   - Example: A `Truck` class inheriting from a `Vehicle` class.

3. **Polymorphism**  
   - Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.  
   - Example: A method like `startEngine()` behaving differently for `Car` and `Motorcycle`.

4. **Abstraction**  
   - Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.  
   - Example: A `Payment` class with an abstract method `process()` that different payment methods (e.g., `CreditCard`, `PayPal`) implement uniquely.

### **Why Use OOP?**
- **Modularity:** Code is organized into self-contained units (objects), making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Reusability:** Objects and classes can be reused across different parts of a program or in new projects.
- **Scalability:** OOP structures like inheritance and polymorphism make adding new features simpler.
- **Abstraction:** Complex systems can be represented and managed more effectively.

### **OOP in JavaScript**
JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning objects inherit directly from other objects using prototypes. However, modern JavaScript (ES6+) supports OOP features like **classes**, **inheritance**, and **encapsulation**, which make implementing OOP concepts more intuitive.
