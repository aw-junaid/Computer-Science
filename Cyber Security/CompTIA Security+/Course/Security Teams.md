     - Analyze and interpret threat data to identify attack patterns, tactics, and techniques used by adversaries.
     - Provide threat intelligence reports and briefings to relevant stakeholders to inform security strategies.

6. **Risk Management Team**
   - **Description**: The risk management team assesses potential threats and vulnerabilities to the organization’s assets and works to minimize the overall risk exposure.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Conduct risk assessments to identify and evaluate potential security risks to the organization.
     - Develop risk mitigation strategies and implement control measures.
     - Ensure compliance with industry regulations and frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001).
     - Work with other teams to ensure that identified risks are addressed and mitigated.

7. **Security Engineers**
   - **Description**: Security engineers are responsible for implementing and maintaining security tools and technologies that protect the organization’s infrastructure, applications, and data.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Configure and manage firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
     - Maintain endpoint protection solutions (antivirus software, EDR platforms).
     - Conduct vulnerability management by patching software and configuring security settings.
     - Implement network security protocols like VPNs and encryption.

8. **Compliance and Audit Team**
   - **Description**: This team is responsible for ensuring that the organization complies with legal, regulatory, and industry-specific standards. They also perform audits to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify any gaps.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Ensure compliance with laws and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and others.
     - Conduct internal and external audits to assess the security posture of systems.
     - Develop and maintain policies, procedures, and standards to ensure security compliance.
     - Report findings and recommend corrective actions to address compliance gaps.

9. **Application Security Team**
   - **Description**: The application security team focuses on securing applications throughout their development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Conduct security assessments on software and web applications, including static and dynamic analysis.
     - Collaborate with developers to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the code (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
     - Implement secure development practices (e.g., secure coding standards, code reviews, threat modeling).
     - Perform regular security testing to ensure applications remain secure post-deployment.

10. **Forensic Analysts**
    - **Description**: Forensic analysts are responsible for investigating security incidents after they occur, preserving evidence, and determining the scope and nature of the attack.
    - **Responsibilities**:

### **Collaboration Among Security Teams**

1. **Incident Response and Communication**:
   - Security teams must work together to handle security incidents effectively. For example, SOC analysts may detect a potential security breach, which is then escalated to incident responders. The forensic team may step in to collect evidence, while the risk management team evaluates the organizational impact.

2. **Cross-functional Collaboration**:
   - Security teams collaborate with IT, legal, compliance, and executive teams to ensure that security strategies align with the organization's goals and regulatory requirements. Regular communication and updates help in maintaining a unified security posture.

3. **Security Awareness**:
   - Security teams, particularly those in training and compliance, educate employees about security best practices, phishing threats, and the importance of strong password management. This reduces the chances of human error, which is a major vulnerability.

4. **Proactive Threat Hunting**:
   - Some security teams, such as threat intelligence analysts and penetration testers, proactively hunt for potential threats and weaknesses within the organization’s infrastructure before attackers can exploit them.

5. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**:
   - Security teams are involved in the ongoing monitoring of systems, applications, and networks to detect new threats. They also provide recommendations for improvements, implement new technologies, and adapt security measures to evolving threat landscapes.
