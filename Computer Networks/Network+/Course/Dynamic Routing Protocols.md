### **Dynamic Routing Protocols**

Dynamic routing protocols enable routers to automatically exchange routing information and adjust their routing tables in real-time. These protocols provide the necessary intelligence to adapt to changes in network topology, making dynamic routing more efficient and resilient than static routing.

There are several types of dynamic routing protocols, each with its own set of features, advantages, and use cases. They are generally divided into **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)** and **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)**, based on whether they operate within a single Autonomous System (AS) or between multiple ASes.

### **Types of Dynamic Routing Protocols**

1. **Distance-Vector Routing Protocols**
2. **Link-State Routing Protocols**
3. **Hybrid Routing Protocols**

---

### **1. Distance-Vector Routing Protocols**

Distance-vector protocols are based on the concept of "distance" and "direction." These protocols share routing tables with directly connected neighbors, and each router makes its routing decisions based on the best available route, using the number of hops or other metrics.

#### **Common Distance-Vector Protocols**

- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
  - **Metric**: Hop count (max of 15 hops, anything beyond 15 is considered unreachable).
  - **Versions**:
    - **RIP v1**: Classful, does not support Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM).
    - **RIP v2**: Classless, supports VLSM and multicast updates.
  - **Convergence**: Slow, since it relies on periodic updates (every 30 seconds).
  - **Use Case**: Suitable for small networks where simplicity is more important than scalability.

  **Example Cisco Command**:
  ```bash
  router rip
  version 2
  network 192.168.1.0
  ```

- **IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**  
  - **Metric**: Uses bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load.
  - **Cisco proprietary**, which was phased out in favor of **EIGRP**.
  - **Convergence**: Faster than RIP.
  - **Use Case**: Was used in medium-sized enterprise networks.

### **2. Link-State Routing Protocols**

Link-state protocols take a different approach from distance-vector protocols by having routers independently determine the entire network's topology. Each router sends out updates to all other routers in the network, providing detailed information about its links and their states.

#### **Common Link-State Protocols**

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
  - **Metric**: Cost (based on bandwidth).
  - **Features**: 
    - **LSA (Link-State Advertisements)** are used to exchange information about the router's links.
    - OSPF supports **areas**, allowing hierarchical network designs (e.g., backbone area 0).
    - **Fast convergence** compared to RIP.
    - **Scalable** and suitable for large networks.
  - **Use Case**: Common in large enterprise networks with multiple routers.

  **Example Cisco Command**:
  ```bash
  router ospf 1
  network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
  ```

- **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**
  - **Metric**: Cost (similar to OSPF).
  - **Features**: 
    - Primarily used in large service provider networks.
    - **Hierarchical routing** similar to OSPF with levels (IS-IS Level 1 and Level 2).
    - Scalable and fast convergence.
  - **Use Case**: Mainly used in large-scale ISP networks.

  **Example Cisco Command**:
  ```bash
  router isis
  net 49.0001.1921.6800.1000.00
  ```

### **3. Hybrid Routing Protocols**

Hybrid protocols combine the features of both distance-vector and link-state protocols. These protocols attempt to combine the best of both worlds: the simplicity of distance-vector protocols and the scalability and fast convergence of link-state protocols.

#### **Common Hybrid Routing Protocols**

- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
  - **Metric**: Bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and MTU.
  - **Features**:
    - Cisco proprietary.
    - **Dual algorithm**: Uses Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to calculate the best path.
    - **Fast convergence** (faster than RIP and OSPF).
    - **Supports VLSM and CIDR**.
    - More efficient than RIP for medium to large networks.
  - **Use Case**: Common in large enterprise networks, especially where Cisco equipment is used.

  **Example Cisco Command**:
  ```bash
  router eigrp 100
  network 192.168.1.0
  ```

### **4. Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)**

EGPs are used for routing between different Autonomous Systems (ASes). **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** is the most commonly used EGP.

#### **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
  - **Type**: Path-vector protocol.
  - **Metric**: AS path (sequence of ASes a packet passes through).
  - **Features**:
    - Used to exchange routing information between different Autonomous Systems.
    - **Supports policy-based routing**, allowing traffic to be routed based on business needs.
    - **Scalable**: Suitable for the global internet.
    - **Slow convergence**: BGP can take longer to converge, but it is designed for stability and scalability.
    - **Supports CIDR** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
  - **Use Case**: Used for inter-domain routing, typically by ISPs and large organizations.

  **Example Cisco Command**:
  ```bash
  router bgp 65001
  neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65002
  network 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0
  ```

### **When to Use Each Routing Protocol**

- **Use RIP**:
  - In small, simple networks where ease of configuration is key.
  - Networks that do not require fast convergence or scalability.

- **Use OSPF**:
  - In large, hierarchical networks requiring fast convergence and scalability.
  - Networks with multiple routers, where flexibility and cost-based routing are needed.

- **Use EIGRP**:
  - In Cisco-based networks where fast convergence and scalability are critical.
  - Medium to large-sized enterprise networks.

- **Use IS-IS**:
  - For service provider networks or when scaling large routing domains is necessary.

- **Use BGP**:
  - For inter-domain routing (between different Autonomous Systems).
  - In ISPs or large organizations that need fine control over routing paths and policies.

### **Conclusion**

Dynamic routing protocols provide significant advantages in large and constantly changing networks by enabling routers to automatically discover and adjust to changes in network topology. Choosing the appropriate dynamic routing protocol depends on the size of the network, the required scalability, convergence speed, and the type of equipment in use.
