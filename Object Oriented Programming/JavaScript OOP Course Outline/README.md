   - Public vs. private properties
   - Using `#` for private fields
   - Accessor methods: getters and setters
2. **Encapsulating Behavior**
   - Methods to hide implementation details
   - Best practices for encapsulation

---

### **Module 4: Inheritance**
1. **Extending Classes**

   - Calling the parent class constructor with `super()`
2. **Method Overriding**
   - Overriding methods in derived classes
   - Using `super.method()` to call parent methods
3. **Prototypal Inheritance**
   - Prototype chains
   - `Object.create()` and `Object.getPrototypeOf()`

---

### **Module 5: Polymorphism**
1. **What is Polymorphism?**
   - Implementing polymorphism in JavaScript
2. **Dynamic Method Dispatch**
   - Examples of runtime method overriding
3. **Benefits of Polymorphism**
   - Flexibility and reusability

---

### **Module 6: Abstraction**
1. **What is Abstraction?**
   - Hiding complexity with abstraction
2. **Abstract Classes in JavaScript**
   - Simulating abstract classes using base classes
   - Creating contract-like methods in child classes
3. **Using Interfaces**
   - Mimicking interfaces using design patterns

---

### **Module 7: Advanced OOP Concepts**
1. **Static Properties and Methods**
   - Defining and accessing static members
   - Use cases for static members
2. **Mixins**
   - Combining functionalities from multiple objects
   - Creating reusable mixin patterns
3. **Composition vs. Inheritance**
   - When to use inheritance vs. composition
   - Implementing composition patterns in JavaScript

---

### **Module 8: JavaScript Prototypes**
1. **Prototype-based Inheritance**
   - How prototypes work in JavaScript
   - `__proto__` and `Object.prototype`
2. **Prototype Methods**
   - Common methods: `Object.hasOwnProperty()`, `Object.keys()`, etc.
3. **Manipulating Prototypes**
   - Adding methods to prototypes
   - Overriding default prototype methods

---

### **Module 9: Design Patterns in OOP**
1. **Introduction to Design Patterns**
   - What are design patterns?
   - Importance in software development
2. **Common OOP Design Patterns**
   - Singleton
   - Factory
   - Observer
   - Decorator

---

### **Module 10: Practical Applications**
1. **Building a Real-world Application**
   - Use OOP concepts to design a project (e.g., Task Manager, E-commerce Cart, etc.)
2. **Refactoring Code**
   - Improving existing code using OOP principles
3. **Debugging and Testing**
   - Tools and techniques for OOP JavaScript applications

---

### **Module 11: OOP in Modern JavaScript Frameworks**
1. **OOP Concepts in Frameworks**
   - OOP in React, Angular, and Vue
2. **State Management and OOP**
   - Integrating OOP principles with state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Vuex)

---

### **Module 12: Performance and Best Practices**
1. **Optimizing OOP Code**
   - Avoiding common pitfalls (e.g., excessive inheritance)
2. **Memory Management**
   - Understanding garbage collection in JavaScript
3. **Writing Maintainable OOP Code**
   - Naming conventions and structure
   - Documentation and comments

---

### **Course Summary and Final Project**
