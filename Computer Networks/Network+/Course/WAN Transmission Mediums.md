- **Types**:
  - **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)**: Designed for long-distance communication with higher bandwidth.
  - **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)**: Suitable for shorter distances, typically within buildings or campuses.

- **Advantages**:
  - High bandwidth and low latency.
  - Immune to electromagnetic interference.
  - Supports long-distance transmission without repeaters.

- **Limitations**:
  - Higher installation and equipment costs.
  - Requires specialized tools and expertise for installation.

### **3. Microwave Links**

- **Description**:
  - Wireless transmission using high-frequency radio waves.
  - Often used for line-of-sight communication between fixed points.

- **Applications**:
  - Connecting remote or rural areas where laying cables is impractical.
  - Cellular backhaul and satellite communication.

- **Advantages**:
  - Rapid deployment and scalability.
  - Useful for areas with challenging terrain.

- **Limitations**:
  - Requires clear line-of-sight.
  - Affected by weather conditions (e.g., rain fade).

### **5. Radio Frequency (RF)**

- **Description**:
  - Wireless transmission using radio waves for short to medium distances.
  - Commonly used in wireless WANs, such as Wi-Fi and LTE networks.

- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible and cost-effective for mobile devices.
  - Easy to deploy in urban and semi-urban areas.

- **Limitations**:
  - Limited bandwidth compared to fiber optics.
  - Prone to interference from other wireless signals.

- **Description**:
  - High-speed internet connections over existing infrastructure like DSL, cable, or fiber.
  - Suitable for home offices and small businesses.

- **Types**:
  - **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: Transmits data over traditional telephone lines.
  - **Cable Broadband**: Uses coaxial cables to deliver internet services.

- **Advantages**:
  - Affordable and easy to deploy.
  - Widely available in urban and suburban areas.

- **Limitations**:
  - Bandwidth shared among users in the same area (for cable).
  - Limited speeds compared to dedicated fiber lines.

### **8. MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**

- **Description**:
  - A routing technique that uses labels to direct data packets.
  - Operates on top of existing transmission mediums like fiber or copper.

- **Advantages**:
  - High reliability and QoS (Quality of Service).
  - Suitable for enterprise-grade WANs.

- **Limitations**:
  - Expensive compared to public broadband solutions.
  - Requires contractual agreements with service providers.
