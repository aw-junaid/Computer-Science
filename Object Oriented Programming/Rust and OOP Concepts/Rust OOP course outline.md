**Rust OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Course Outline** tailored for a structured learning experience:
---

### **Module 1: Introduction to Rust and OOP Concepts**
- Overview of Rust’s approach to OOP
- Understanding Rust’s ownership and borrowing
- Why Rust favors composition over inheritance
- Differences between traditional OOP and Rust's paradigms

---

### **Module 2: Structs and Enums as Core Data Structures**
- Defining and using structs
- Implementing methods with `impl`
- Enums for type-safe variants
- Pattern matching with enums

---

### **Module 3: Traits and Polymorphism**
- Understanding and defining traits
- Implementing traits for custom types
- Dynamic dispatch with `dyn` and trait objects
- Static dispatch and generic traits

---

### **Module 4: Encapsulation in Rust**
- Managing visibility with `pub`
- Structuring modules for encapsulation
- Using getter and setter methods
- Practical examples of encapsulation in Rust

---

### **Module 5: Implementing Inheritance-like Behavior**
- Composition in Rust: Delegation vs Inheritance
- Using traits to share behavior between types
- Building extensible systems with default trait implementations

---

### **Module 6: Ownership, Lifetimes, and Smart Pointers in OOP**
- Role of ownership in object-oriented design
- Lifetimes in method implementations
- Using `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc` for smart pointers
- Managing circular references and avoiding memory leaks

---

### **Module 7: Advanced Trait Usage**
- Trait bounds and where clauses
- Using associated types in traits
- Trait object safety and advanced use cases
- Blanket implementations for generic programming

---

### **Module 8: Error Handling and Object-Oriented Design**
- Error handling patterns in Rust
- Designing robust systems with `Result` and `Option`
- Implementing custom error types with traits

---

### **Module 9: Practical OOP with Rust**
- Building a mini-project with object-oriented principles
- Designing abstractions using traits and structs
- Refactoring to ensure idiomatic Rust practices

---

### **Module 10: Comparing Rust OOP with Other Languages**
- Key differences between Rust and traditional OOP languages (Java, C++, Python)
- When and why to choose Rust for OOP
- Case studies: Real-world OOP projects in Rust

---

### **Final Project**
- **Capstone Project**: Build a complex application (e.g., a role-based user management system, a plugin-based architecture, or a game engine module)
- Focus on applying traits, encapsulation, and ownership principles in a real-world scenario.
