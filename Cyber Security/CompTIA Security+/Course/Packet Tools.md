  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
  ```
- Save captured packets to a file:  
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
  ```

### **5. hping3**

**Description**:  
`hping3` is a network tool that sends custom TCP/IP packets and analyzes responses. It is often used for network testing and firewall auditing.

**Use Case**:  
- Firewall testing  
- Network performance testing  
- Crafting custom packets  

**Installation**:  
```bash
sudo apt-get install hping3
```

**Example Commands**:  
- Send TCP SYN packets to a target:  
  ```bash
  sudo hping3 -S -p 80 192.168.1.1
  ```
- Perform a flood attack (for testing purposes):  
  ```bash
  sudo hping3 --flood -p 80 192.168.1.1
  ```

### **6. ngrep**

**Description**:  
`ngrep` is a network packet analyzer that allows you to search for specific patterns in network traffic. It combines the functionality of `grep` with packet capture.

**Use Case**:  
- Searching for specific strings in network traffic  
- Monitoring HTTP requests and responses  

**Installation**:  
```bash
sudo apt-get install ngrep
```

**Example Commands**:  
- Capture HTTP traffic and search for "GET" requests:  
  ```bash
  sudo ngrep -q -W byline "GET" port 80
  ```
