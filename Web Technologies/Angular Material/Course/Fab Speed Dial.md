**Angular Material Fab Speed Dial** is a floating action button (FAB) with a speed dial (a set of action buttons that are revealed when the FAB is clicked). It is often used to provide users with a quick access menu of actions without cluttering the UI. This is a variation of the **floating action button** that provides additional options in a circular layout when activated.

The `mat-fab-speed-dial` component in Angular Material is a highly customizable tool that helps you implement this pattern in your application.

### Key Features of `mat-fab-speed-dial`:
- **Floating Action Button**: The main button (FAB) that floats on the screen and triggers the speed dial.
- **Multiple Actions**: A set of actions that appear when the FAB is clicked or activated.
- **Animation**: The buttons animate into view, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the speed dial with icons, labels, and action events.
- **Accessibility**: Angular Material provides built-in support for accessibility features.

### Setting Up Fab Speed Dial in Angular

1. **Import Angular Material Modules**:
Make sure you have the required modules in your Angular application.

```typescript
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';
import { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';
import { MatFabSpeedDialModule } from '@angular/material/fab-speed-dial';
```

2. **Include Angular Material Theme**:
Ensure the styles are included by adding a Material theme in `styles.css` (or `angular.json`).

```css
@import '@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css';
```

### Basic Example of Fab Speed Dial

```html
<mat-fab-speed-dial #fabSpeedDial
  [icon]="'add'"
  [open]="fabOpen"
  (opened)="onFabOpen()"
  (closed)="onFabClose()">
  
  <button mat-mini-fab *ngFor="let action of actions" (click)="actionClicked(action)">
    <mat-icon>{{ action.icon }}</mat-icon>
  </button>
</mat-fab-speed-dial>
```

In this example:
- **`mat-fab-speed-dial`**: The main floating action button that triggers the speed dial.
- **`[icon]="'add'"`**: Specifies the icon for the FAB. In this case, it's an "add" icon (you can use any material icon).
- **`[open]="fabOpen"`**: This binds the open state of the speed dial. You can toggle it programmatically.
- **`(opened)` and `(closed)`**: Events triggered when the FAB is opened or closed.

### Handling Speed Dial Actions in Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-speed-dial',
  templateUrl: './speed-dial.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./speed-dial.component.css']
})
export class SpeedDialComponent {
  fabOpen = false;
  actions = [
    { icon: 'create', label: 'Create' },
    { icon: 'edit', label: 'Edit' },
    { icon: 'delete', label: 'Delete' }
  ];

  onFabOpen() {
    console.log('FAB opened');
  }

  onFabClose() {
    console.log('FAB closed');
  }

  actionClicked(action) {
    console.log(`${action.label} clicked`);
  }
}
```

- **`actions`**: This is an array of actions with each having an `icon` and `label`.
- **`onFabOpen()`** and **`onFabClose()`**: These methods handle when the FAB is opened or closed.
- **`actionClicked(action)`**: This method is called when any of the action buttons are clicked.

### Customizing the Fab Speed Dial

1. **Positioning and Styling**:
You can customize the positioning of the speed dial and its buttons by adding custom CSS.

```css
mat-fab-speed-dial {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
```

This CSS snippet places the FAB at the bottom-right of the screen. You can adjust the position according to your needs.

2. **Icon Customization**:
The FAB and action buttons can be customized with Material icons or your own images.

```html
<mat-fab-speed-dial #fabSpeedDial
  [icon]="'add'"
  [open]="fabOpen">
  
  <button mat-mini-fab *ngFor="let action of actions" (click)="actionClicked(action)">
    <mat-icon>{{ action.icon }}</mat-icon>
  </button>
</mat-fab-speed-dial>
```

Alternatively, you can use custom images or SVG icons inside the buttons:

```html
<button mat-mini-fab *ngFor="let action of actions" (click)="actionClicked(action)">
  <img src="assets/custom-icon.svg" alt="icon">
</button>
```

3. **Responsive Design**:
You can use breakpoints to control when the FAB should appear or change its behavior based on screen size. For example, on mobile screens, you may want the FAB to collapse or behave differently.

```html
<mat-fab-speed-dial [icon]="'add'" [open]="fabOpen">
  <button mat-mini-fab *ngFor="let action of actions" (click)="actionClicked(action)">
    <mat-icon>{{ action.icon }}</mat-icon>
  </button>
</mat-fab-speed-dial>
```

You could use a media query to hide or change the behavior of the FAB on smaller screens.
