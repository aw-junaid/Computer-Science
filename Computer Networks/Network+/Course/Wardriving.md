### **Wardriving**

**Wardriving** is the act of searching for wireless networks (usually Wi-Fi) by driving around in a vehicle or moving through an area while using a mobile device (such as a laptop, smartphone, or tablet) to detect and map unsecured or poorly secured wireless networks. The primary goal of wardriving is typically to identify open or weakly secured wireless access points (APs) that could be exploited by attackers.

While wardriving itself is not necessarily illegal, it becomes unethical or illegal when used for malicious purposes, such as attempting to gain unauthorized access to networks, eavesdrop on network traffic, or exploit vulnerabilities in wireless networks.

### **How Wardriving Works**

1. **Mapping Wireless Networks**:
   - Wardrivers use specialized software or apps, such as **NetStumbler**, **Kismet**, or **WiFi Analyzer**, to detect wireless networks as they move through a particular area. These tools scan for Wi-Fi signals, including information such as the SSID (network name), signal strength, MAC address, encryption type, and other metadata about the network.

2. **Location Tracking**:
   - Wardrivers often combine the use of GPS (Global Positioning System) devices with network scanning tools to map the geographic locations of wireless networks they detect. This allows them to create detailed maps of where various Wi-Fi networks are located, their security settings, and whether they are open or secured.

3. **Logging Information**:
   - The detected networks, along with the associated information (SSID, signal strength, encryption type, etc.), are logged and stored in a database. This information can be used to identify vulnerable networks that can be further attacked or exploited.

4. **Mapping Software**:
   - After gathering data from multiple locations, wardrivers can use mapping software like **Google Maps** or **Wardriving-specific tools** to visually display the locations of detected networks on a map, along with details about their security configurations.

### **Risks and Threats of Wardriving**

1. **Exposure of Unsecured Networks**:
   - The primary risk posed by wardriving is the identification of **open (unsecured) Wi-Fi networks** or networks with weak security settings. These networks are often targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access, eavesdrop on traffic, or launch further attacks.
   
   - For example, networks that use weak encryption protocols like WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) can be easily cracked, providing attackers access to the network.

2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**:
   - Once a wardriver identifies an unsecured or weakly secured network, they can attempt to connect to it and launch **Man-in-the-Middle** (MitM) attacks. In a MitM attack, the attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between the network and legitimate users, stealing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, and personal data.

3. **Eavesdropping on Wireless Traffic**:
   - Wardrivers can use tools to monitor and capture unencrypted traffic (such as **HTTP**, **FTP**, or **email traffic**) transmitted over the network. This gives them the ability to collect sensitive information that could be exploited.

4. **Network Disruption or Hijacking**:
   - In some cases, wardrivers may use their access to disrupt the normal operation of a network. They could launch **denial-of-service (DoS)** attacks or hijack the network for malicious activities like botnet control or spreading malware.

### **Legality of Wardriving**

- **Legal Aspects**:
   - Simply scanning for wireless networks while driving around is generally **not illegal** in many jurisdictions. It is similar to scanning for radio signals, as it involves listening to public signals without necessarily interfering with the network.
   - However, the **intent and actions** following the detection of a wireless network can make wardriving illegal. For example, accessing an unsecured network without permission, eavesdropping on network traffic, or attempting to exploit network vulnerabilities constitutes **unauthorized access**, which is illegal in many countries.

- **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Wardriving can be used for legitimate purposes, such as network surveying and detecting insecure networks, but when done with malicious intent or to exploit weak security, it becomes an unethical and illegal activity.
   - Ethical hackers or security researchers may use wardriving techniques to identify insecure networks and report them to the owners, helping them secure their networks. However, this should only be done with proper authorization and consent.

### **Common Tools Used for Wardriving**

1. **Kismet**:
   - **Kismet** is a popular wireless network detector and sniffer tool that can be used for wardriving. It supports GPS integration and can detect hidden SSIDs, allowing wardrivers to map wireless networks in a particular area.

2. **NetStumbler**:
   - **NetStumbler** is a well-known tool for wardriving on Windows-based systems. It scans for wireless networks and provides detailed information about the network, including signal strength, encryption type, and more.

3. **WiFi Analyzer**:
   - **WiFi Analyzer** is a mobile app available on Android devices that allows users to scan for Wi-Fi networks in the vicinity. It can show detailed information such as channel usage, signal strength, and network security.

4. **Wardrive (iOS app)**:
   - **Wardrive** is an iOS application that allows users to map wireless networks in a geographical area and log information about them.

5. **Aircrack-ng**:
   - **Aircrack-ng** is a popular tool for cracking WEP and WPA encryption on wireless networks. It is used by some attackers during wardriving to break into weakly encrypted networks.

### **Defending Against Wardriving**

1. **Use Strong Encryption**:
   - Always use **WPA2** or **WPA3** encryption for wireless networks. Avoid using **WEP**, as it is highly insecure and can be easily cracked. Strong encryption prevents attackers from eavesdropping on network traffic or attempting unauthorized access.

2. **Hide SSID**:
   - Hiding the **SSID** (Service Set Identifier) of a wireless network can make it more difficult for wardrivers to identify the network. However, this is not a foolproof method, as tools like Kismet can still detect hidden SSIDs by capturing their broadcast.

3. **Use MAC Address Filtering**:
   - **MAC address filtering** restricts which devices are allowed to connect to a network based on their MAC addresses. This adds an extra layer of security but can be bypassed by attackers who spoof MAC addresses.

4. **Monitor and Audit Wireless Networks**:
   - Regularly scan and monitor the wireless network for unknown devices or unusual activity. Utilize wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS) that can alert administrators to unauthorized access or devices attempting to connect to the network.

5. **Change Default Passwords**:
   - Change default router credentials and Wi-Fi passwords. Many devices come with easily guessable default passwords that can be exploited by attackers.

6. **VPN and Secure Communication**:
   - Encourage users to connect through a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**, especially when accessing public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks. A VPN encrypts the user's internet traffic, preventing attackers from intercepting or eavesdropping on sensitive data.

### **Conclusion**

Wardriving is a practice that involves searching for wireless networks, often for the purpose of detecting unsecured or poorly secured networks. While it is not inherently illegal, wardriving becomes a significant security concern when it is used for malicious activities, such as gaining unauthorized access to networks or launching attacks. Organizations and individuals can defend against wardrivers by employing strong encryption, monitoring network activity, and following best practices to secure their wireless networks from unauthorized access and exploitation.
