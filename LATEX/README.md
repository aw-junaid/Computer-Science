LaTeX (pronounced "Lay-tech" or "Lah-tech") is a document preparation system widely used for creating professional-quality documents. It is particularly popular in academia, especially in fields such as mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering, where documents often include complex mathematical formulas and technical content.
