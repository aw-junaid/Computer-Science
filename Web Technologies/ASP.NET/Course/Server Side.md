### ASP.NET - Server Side

In ASP.NET, **server-side** programming refers to the logic that is executed on the web server, rather than on the clientâ€™s browser. The server handles client requests, processes them (e.g., by interacting with databases or executing business logic), and returns a response (usually HTML, JSON, or other data formats) to the client. Server-side processing ensures that sensitive logic, data access, and security are maintained away from the client.

ASP.NET offers several ways to handle server-side logic, depending on the framework you are using (Web Forms, MVC, or Core). Below is an overview of server-side concepts in **ASP.NET Core**, including the lifecycle, page processing, and server-side techniques like handling requests, session management, and working with databases.

### 1. **ASP.NET Core Server-Side Architecture**

ASP.NET Core is a modern, cross-platform framework for building web applications. Server-side logic in ASP.NET Core typically revolves around:

- **Controllers and Actions**: Handle HTTP requests and return responses.
- **Middleware**: Intercepts requests and responses to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, and more.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: ASP.NET Core has built-in support for Dependency Injection, which helps to manage dependencies for services like database connections, logging, and other components.

#### **Key Components in ASP.NET Core Server-Side Processing**

- **Middleware**: The pipeline that processes HTTP requests and responses. Middleware can be used for various tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, etc.
- **Controllers**: Classes that handle HTTP requests, typically via actions (methods) that process requests and return results such as views, data, or redirects.
- **Views**: Rendered HTML that is returned to the client. Razor Views (`.cshtml`) are commonly used to dynamically generate HTML.
- **Services**: Business logic and data handling (e.g., connecting to databases or external APIs). Services can be injected into controllers or pages via Dependency Injection.

### 2. **Processing a Server-Side Request in ASP.NET Core**

In ASP.NET Core, the process of handling a request follows a clear sequence of steps. Here's a general flow of request processing:

1. **Request Reception**:
   - The client sends an HTTP request to the web server (e.g., a form submission or a page load request).
   
2. **Routing**:
   - The **Routing** middleware matches the URL to a controller action or Razor page handler.
   
3. **Middleware Execution**:
   - ASP.NET Core uses a middleware pipeline that can be customized for various purposes like authentication, authorization, logging, and more.
   
4. **Controller Action or Razor Page Execution**:
   - Once the request is routed to the appropriate controller or page, the associated action or handler is executed to process the request.
   
5. **Response**:
   - The result of the controller action or Razor Page handler (such as HTML, JSON, or a redirect) is returned as the HTTP response to the client.

#### Example of Request Flow in ASP.NET Core:

- The client accesses `http://localhost/Home/Index`.
- **Routing** maps the URL to the `Index` action in the `HomeController`.
- **Middleware** processes the request (e.g., checking for authentication).
- The `HomeController.Index` method executes and returns a view (`Index.cshtml`).
- The server sends the response back to the client.

### 3. **Server-Side Code in ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core allows you to handle server-side logic through **Controllers**, **Razor Pages**, and **Services**.

#### **Controllers and Actions (MVC)**

In ASP.NET Core MVC, a **Controller** is responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses. Each action in a controller maps to a specific HTTP request.

**Example of a Controller**:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            // Server-side logic to process the request
            ViewData["Message"] = "Hello, ASP.NET Core!";
            return View(); // Returns the Index view with the message
        }
        
        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult SubmitData(string name)
        {
            // Server-side logic to process submitted data
            ViewData["Message"] = $"Hello, {name}!";
            return View("Index");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Index` action handles a GET request to render a page.
- The `SubmitData` action handles a POST request to process form data and return a response.

#### **Razor Pages**

Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core is an alternative to MVC for server-side rendering. It simplifies the structure by using **page models** (akin to controllers in MVC) for handling HTTP requests.

**Example of Razor Page Handling Server-Side Request**:

1. **Razor Page** (`Pages/Index.cshtml`):

```html
@page
@model MyApp.Pages.IndexModel

<h2>@Model.Message</h2>

<form method="post">
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

2. **Page Model** (`Pages/Index.cshtml.cs`):

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

namespace MyApp.Pages
{
    public class IndexModel : PageModel
    {
        [BindProperty]
        public string Name { get; set; }
        
        public string Message { get; set; }

        public void OnGet()
        {
            Message = "Enter your name to greet.";
        }

        public void OnPost()
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Name))
            {
                Message = "Hello, Guest!";
            }
            else
            {
                Message = $"Hello, {Name}!";
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here:
- The `OnGet` method handles GET requests (renders the page).
- The `OnPost` method handles POST requests (processes form data and updates the page).

### 4. **Session Management in ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core provides the ability to store data on the server between requests using **sessions**. Session management is useful for storing user-specific data, such as authentication tokens, shopping cart contents, etc.

#### Enabling Session:

1. Add session services in the `Startup.cs` file:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();  // Adds a memory cache for session storage
    services.AddSession(options => {
        options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30); // Set session timeout
    });
}
```

2. Add session middleware in the `Configure` method:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseSession(); // Enable session management
}
```

3. Use session in a controller or Razor page:

```csharp
public IActionResult SetSession()
{
    HttpContext.Session.SetString("Username", "JohnDoe");  // Store data in session
    return View();
}

public IActionResult GetSession()
{
    var username = HttpContext.Session.GetString("Username");  // Retrieve session data
    return Content($"Hello, {username}");
}
```

### 5. **Server-Side Validation and Data Handling**

ASP.NET Core provides built-in mechanisms to handle server-side validation of user inputs, both on Razor Pages and in MVC controllers.

#### Example of Server-Side Validation in a Razor Page:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

namespace MyApp.Pages
{
    public class FormModel : PageModel
    {
        [BindProperty]
        [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required")]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public void OnPost()
        {
            if (ModelState.IsValid)
            {
                // Process data if valid
            }
            else
            {
                // Handle validation errors
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Name` property is validated to ensure it's not empty. If the validation fails, the page will display an error message.

### 6. **Working with Databases Server-Side**

In ASP.NET Core, you can interact with databases server-side using **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**, which provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) solution.

#### Example: Connecting to a Database with EF Core

1. **Define a Model** (`Models/User.cs`):

```csharp
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

2. **Create a DbContext** (`Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`):

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace MyApp.Data
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options) { }

        public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
    }
}
```

3. **Configure EF Core in Startup** (`Startup.cs`):

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
}
```

4. **Query the Database in a Controller or Razor Page**:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public HomeController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var users = _context.Users.ToList(); // Retrieve all users from the database
        return View(users);
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

Server-side programming in ASP.NET involves handling HTTP requests, processing data on the server, managing user sessions, and interacting with databases. ASP.NET Core provides various techniques for managing server-side logic:
- **Controllers and Actions** in MVC for structured request handling.
- **Razor Pages** for a simplified model with server-side event handling.
- **Middleware** to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- **Session Management** for maintaining state between requests.
- **Entity Framework Core** for database operations.

These tools enable developers to build dynamic, scalable, and secure web applications.
