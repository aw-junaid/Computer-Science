### **Differences Between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

Procedural Programming (PP) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are two distinct paradigms used in software development. Each has unique characteristics, advantages, and use cases. Below is a comparison between the two approaches:

---

| **Feature**                  | **Procedural Programming (PP)**                                       | **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**                                |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core Concept**             | Focuses on functions and procedures to perform tasks.                | Focuses on objects that encapsulate data and behavior.               |
| **Data Handling**            | Data and functions are separate. Functions operate on data.          | Data and functions are combined into objects (encapsulation).        |
| **Structure**                | Programs are divided into functions or procedures.                   | Programs are organized into classes and objects.                     |
| **Approach**                 | Follows a top-down approach.                                         | Follows a bottom-up approach.                                        |
| **Reusability**              | Limited reusability; requires copying and modifying functions.        | High reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.               |
| **Abstraction**              | Abstraction is achieved through functions and modules.               | Abstraction is achieved using classes and interfaces.                |
| **Encapsulation**            | Does not support encapsulation directly; relies on disciplined coding. | Encapsulation is a core feature, enabling better data security.      |
| **Inheritance**              | Not supported.                                                       | Inheritance is supported, enabling code reuse and hierarchy.         |
| **Polymorphism**             | Not supported.                                                       | Supported via function overloading and overriding.                   |
| **Code Maintenance**         | Can become complex and harder to maintain as the program grows.       | Easier to maintain due to modular and reusable components.           |
| **Examples of Languages**    | C, Pascal, BASIC.                                                    | C++, Java, Python, C#.                                               |

### **1. Procedural Programming**
**Definition:**  
Procedural Programming is a paradigm where the program is divided into small, reusable procedures or functions. The main focus is on functions and the sequence of execution.

**Characteristics:**  
- Functions are the primary building blocks.  
- Data is passed between functions.  
- No built-in support for OOP concepts like inheritance or encapsulation.  

**Example (C):**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printMessage() {
    printf("Hello from Procedural Programming!\n");
}

int main() {
    printMessage();
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **2. Object-Oriented Programming**
**Definition:**  
Object-Oriented Programming organizes programs into classes and objects, emphasizing data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Characteristics:**  
- Objects are instances of classes.  
- Classes define the blueprint for data and behavior.  
- Core principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  

**Example (C++):**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Greeter {
public:
    void printMessage() {
        cout << "Hello from Object-Oriented Programming!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Greeter greeter;
    greeter.printMessage();
    return 0;
}
```

### **Key Advantages of OOP Over Procedural Programming**
1. **Modularity:**  
   OOP organizes code into self-contained objects, making programs easier to understand, test, and debug.

2. **Code Reusability:**  
   Inheritance and polymorphism reduce code duplication.

3. **Scalability:**  
   OOP makes it easier to scale applications as new features can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

4. **Security:**  
   Encapsulation restricts access to internal object details, enhancing data security.

### **When to Use Procedural vs. OOP**
| **Scenario**                                | **Recommended Paradigm**         |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Small scripts or programs with simple functionality. | Procedural Programming (PP).    |
| Complex, large-scale applications requiring modularity and scalability. | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). |
| Performance-critical systems where low-level control is needed. | Procedural Programming (PP).    |
| Systems requiring data security and reusability. | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). |
