### **Ethernet Standards**

Ethernet is the most widely used technology for local area networks (LANs) and is essential for communication within data centers, enterprise networks, and home networks. Over time, Ethernet standards have evolved to support higher data transfer speeds, longer distances, and better efficiency. These standards are defined by organizations such as IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and are crucial for ensuring network devices can communicate effectively.

Here’s an overview of the key **Ethernet standards**:
