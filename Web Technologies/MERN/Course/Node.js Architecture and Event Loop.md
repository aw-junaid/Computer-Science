Node.js is known for its unique architecture, which is designed to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently. At the core of this architecture is the **Event Loop**, which enables Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations. Let’s break down the architecture and understand how the Event Loop works.

### **Node.js Architecture**
Node.js architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **V8 Engine**:
   - Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript code into native machine code for high performance.

2. **Libuv**:
   - Libuv is a C library that provides the **Event Loop** and handles asynchronous I/O operations (e.g., file system, networking). It abstracts the underlying operating system and provides a consistent API for Node.js.

3. **Event Loop**:
   - The Event Loop is the heart of Node.js. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded.

4. **Thread Pool**:
   - Libuv uses a thread pool (default size: 4 threads) to handle tasks that cannot be performed asynchronously by the operating system (e.g., file I/O, DNS lookups).

5. **Core Modules**:
   - Node.js provides built-in modules (e.g., `http`, `fs`, `path`) that enable developers to perform common tasks without relying on external libraries.

6. **JavaScript Code**:
   - Your application code runs in a single thread, interacting with the Event Loop and Libuv to perform I/O operations.

### **Event Loop**
The Event Loop is what makes Node.js non-blocking and efficient. It continuously checks for events (e.g., incoming requests, completed I/O operations) and processes them asynchronously.

#### **Phases of the Event Loop**
The Event Loop consists of several phases, each responsible for handling specific types of events:

1. **Timers**:
   - Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.

2. **Pending Callbacks**:
   - Executes I/O-related callbacks deferred from the previous cycle (e.g., TCP errors).

3. **Idle, Prepare**:
   - Internal phases used by Libuv for preparation.

4. **Poll**:
   - Retrieves new I/O events and executes their callbacks. If no events are found, it waits for new events.

5. **Check**:
   - Executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate()`.

6. **Close Callbacks**:
   - Executes callbacks for close events (e.g., `socket.on('close', ...)`).

#### **How the Event Loop Works**
1. When your application starts, the Event Loop begins processing events.
2. It moves through each phase, executing the associated callbacks.
3. If there are no more events to process, the Event Loop waits in the **Poll** phase for new events.
4. The loop repeats indefinitely until there are no more events or the application exits.

### **Non-Blocking I/O**
Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations to handle multiple requests efficiently. Here’s how it works:

1. When an I/O operation (e.g., reading a file, querying a database) is initiated, Node.js delegates the task to Libuv.
2. Libuv performs the operation asynchronously using the operating system or the thread pool.
3. While the I/O operation is in progress, the Event Loop continues processing other events.
4. Once the I/O operation is complete, Libuv places the result in the Event Queue.
5. The Event Loop picks up the result and executes the associated callback.

### **Example: Event Loop in Action**
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

console.log("Start");

// Asynchronous file read
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("File read complete");
});

// setTimeout
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout complete");
}, 1000);

// setImmediate
setImmediate(() => {
    console.log("Immediate complete");
});

console.log("End");
```

#### **Output**:
```
Start
End
Immediate complete
File read complete
Timeout complete
```

#### **Explanation**:
1. The script starts by logging `"Start"` and `"End"`.
2. The `setImmediate()` callback is executed in the **Check** phase.
3. The `fs.readFile()` callback is executed in the **Poll** phase once the file is read.
4. The `setTimeout()` callback is executed in the **Timers** phase after 1 second.

---

### **Thread Pool**
While the Event Loop handles most tasks, some operations (e.g., file I/O, DNS lookups) are offloaded to the **Thread Pool**. By default, Libuv creates 4 threads in the pool, but this can be increased using the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable.

#### **Example**:
```javascript
process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 8; // Increase thread pool size
```

### **Advantages of the Event Loop**
1. **Efficiency**:
   - The Event Loop allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Non-blocking I/O makes Node.js highly scalable for real-time applications.
3. **Simplicity**:
   - Developers can write asynchronous code without worrying about multi-threading.

### **Conclusion**
Node.js architecture, powered by the **Event Loop** and **Libuv**, enables high-performance, non-blocking I/O operations. Understanding how the Event Loop works is crucial for writing efficient and scalable Node.js applications. By leveraging its event-driven model, Node.js is ideal for building real-time applications, APIs, and microservices.
