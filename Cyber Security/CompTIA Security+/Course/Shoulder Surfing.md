**Shoulder Surfing** is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker observes an individual’s private information, such as passwords, PINs, or personal data, by looking over their shoulder or from a distance. The goal of shoulder surfing is to gain access to confidential information by watching someone as they interact with their devices, like smartphones, computers, or ATMs.

Shoulder surfing can occur in a variety of public spaces, such as cafes, public transport, offices, or even during business meetings, where individuals may not be aware that they are being observed. Since it doesn’t require the use of sophisticated technology or hacking techniques, shoulder surfing is a relatively simple but effective attack that targets human behavior.

### How Shoulder Surfing Works:

1. **Observation of Device Interaction:**
   - The attacker positions themselves in such a way that they can observe the victim entering sensitive information into a device (e.g., typing a password, PIN, or accessing sensitive data).
   - Attackers can look over the victim’s shoulder or use reflections in windows or mirrors to see the screen.

2. **Watching Online Transactions:**
   - Shoulder surfers may observe victims as they conduct financial transactions online, including entering payment details, credit card numbers, or logging into accounts that require credentials.
   - Example: An attacker watches someone enter their credit card information while shopping on an e-commerce site in a public space.

3. **Monitoring Confidential Conversations:**
   - If the victim is involved in a confidential discussion or meeting, attackers may attempt to overhear or observe sensitive information being shared. This could be in person or via video conferencing.
   - Example: An attacker listens in on a conversation where someone is discussing passwords, company plans, or client details.

4. **Exploiting Public Environments:**
   - The most common locations for shoulder surfing are crowded public places such as airports, coffee shops, libraries, and public transport, where people often work on laptops, smartphones, or ATMs.
   - Example: A person uses their laptop at a coffee shop to access their bank account, unaware that someone sitting nearby is watching their screen.

### Common Targets for Shoulder Surfing:

1. **Individuals Using Mobile Devices:**
   - People using their smartphones or tablets in public are prime targets for shoulder surfers, as these devices often contain sensitive personal information, emails, messages, or banking apps.
   - Example: An attacker watches as someone enters their email password or logs into a social media account.

2. **ATM Users:**
   - ATMs are common targets for shoulder surfing, as users often input sensitive information such as PIN codes and withdrawal amounts.
   - Example: An attacker stands near someone at an ATM and watches them enter their PIN and the amount they wish to withdraw.

3. **Laptop and Computer Users in Public Spaces:**
   - People working on laptops or desktops in public areas may unknowingly expose sensitive data such as login credentials, account information, or personal details.
   - Example: A person working on an online shopping website may expose their credit card number or address, which an attacker can later use.

4. **Business Professionals and Executives:**
   - Executives or employees working with confidential documents, emails, or client information in public spaces are at risk of shoulder surfing.
   - Example: A business executive uses their laptop at a conference or airport, and a nearby person watches them enter sensitive business data or login credentials.

### Techniques Used by Attackers in Shoulder Surfing:

1. **Positioning:**
   - Attackers often position themselves close to the target in order to view the victim’s screen or keypad. This can be done by sitting next to the victim, standing behind them, or using reflections in nearby surfaces (mirrors, windows, or glass).
   
2. **Distraction:**
   - Attackers may use distraction techniques, such as pretending to be busy on their own device or engaging in conversation with someone else, while actually observing the victim’s screen from a distance.

3. **Exploiting Blind Spots:**
   - Attackers may exploit the victim’s failure to notice their surroundings or use natural movements, like turning their head, to catch a glimpse of sensitive information.
   - Example: An attacker might casually glance over a victim’s shoulder when they unlock their phone or input login credentials.

4. **Using Surveillance Devices:**
   - In some cases, attackers may use covert surveillance devices, such as cameras or telescopic lenses, to capture the victim's screen from afar.
   - Example: An attacker uses a small, hidden camera to monitor what’s being typed on a laptop screen in a public setting.

### Risks and Consequences of Shoulder Surfing:

1. **Identity Theft:**
   - Shoulder surfers can collect personal information such as usernames, passwords, PINs, or other sensitive details to impersonate the victim and commit identity theft.
   - Example: An attacker observes someone entering their online banking login details and later uses the credentials to access the account and steal funds.

2. **Financial Fraud:**
   - If attackers observe financial details such as credit card numbers or account numbers, they can use that information to make unauthorized purchases or withdraw funds.
   - Example: An attacker watches someone entering their credit card information on an e-commerce site and later uses the details for fraudulent purchases.

3. **Corporate Espionage:**
   - Shoulder surfing in corporate environments can lead to data breaches or corporate espionage. Attackers can observe confidential business information, such as proprietary data, financial records, or business plans.
   - Example: An attacker watches an employee entering a password to access a confidential database or system.

4. **Privacy Violations:**
   - The invasion of privacy through shoulder surfing can cause individuals to feel unsafe or exposed, especially if their personal conversations, emails, or messages are observed by an unauthorized party.
   - Example: An attacker watches someone enter their personal email password or private social media account credentials.

### Prevention Methods:

1. **Be Aware of Your Environment:**
   - Always be aware of your surroundings and avoid entering sensitive information in public spaces if possible. Look for safe, private locations when accessing sensitive data or conducting financial transactions.
   - Example: Use your laptop or smartphone in a way that limits visibility to others, such as sitting with your back against a wall or sitting in a corner of a room.

2. **Use Privacy Screens:**
   - Privacy screen protectors for laptops, tablets, and smartphones can help obscure the screen’s content from anyone viewing it from the side.
   - Example: Installing a privacy filter on your laptop screen can prevent people from seeing what’s displayed from an angle.

3. **Shield Your Keyboard:**
   - When entering sensitive information such as passwords or PINs, shield your keyboard from view. Hold your device or use your hand to block the keys as you type.
   - Example: Use your body to cover the screen and keypad when entering login credentials in a public place.

4. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
   - Even if an attacker manages to observe your username and password, enabling 2FA can add an additional layer of security. It requires a second form of verification (like a one-time code or biometric scan) to gain access to your accounts.
   - Example: Enable 2FA for your online banking or social media accounts to protect them from unauthorized access, even if your password is observed.

5. **Use Secure Locations for Sensitive Transactions:**
   - Perform sensitive tasks, such as online banking or work-related activities, in secure, private areas like your home or a locked office, away from prying eyes.
   - Example: Avoid logging into sensitive accounts while traveling or in public places like airports or cafes.

6. **Physical Security Measures:**
   - If you're working in a shared office or public space, consider using physical security measures like sitting in a corner or facing away from high-traffic areas to minimize the risk of shoulder surfing.
   - Example: Use a cubicle or a secluded corner when working on a laptop in public or office spaces.

### Conclusion:
Shoulder surfing is a simple yet effective attack that targets human behaviors in public spaces. While it may seem like an old-school method of stealing information, it can still be highly effective if precautions aren't taken. By staying vigilant, using privacy-enhancing tools like screen filters, and avoiding entering sensitive information in public, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of shoulder surfing and protect their personal and financial data.
