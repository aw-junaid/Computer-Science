Implementing a **Mini Gaming Framework** in C using full Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles is a challenge, as C is not inherently an object-oriented language. However, we can simulate object-oriented concepts using **structures**, **function pointers**, and **encapsulation**. This is a good exercise to understand how to apply OOP principles like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** in C.

### **Conceptual Overview**:
1. **Objects**: Simulated using **structures** in C.
2. **Methods**: Simulated using **function pointers** inside structures.
3. **Inheritance**: Simulated by embedding structures.
4. **Polymorphism**: Achieved using **function pointers** for method overriding.

### **Mini Gaming Framework in C**

In this framework, we will create a **Game Object** system where we can define different types of game objects such as **Player** and **Enemy**. Both objects will have a `render` method (to render them on screen) and a `move` method (to handle movement). Each object can have its own implementation of these methods, simulating polymorphism.

---

### **Step 1: Define the Base Game Object**

The base object will have common properties and function pointers for behavior like `move` and `render`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Base class: GameObject
typedef struct GameObject {
    int x, y;   // Position of the object
    void (*move)(struct GameObject*);   // Function pointer for move method
    void (*render)(struct GameObject*); // Function pointer for render method
} GameObject;

// Function to initialize a GameObject
void init_game_object(GameObject* obj, int x, int y, void (*move)(GameObject*), void (*render)(GameObject*)) {
    obj->x = x;
    obj->y = y;
    obj->move = move;
    obj->render = render;
}

void render_game_object(GameObject* obj) {
    obj->render(obj); // Polymorphism: Calls the appropriate render method
}

void move_game_object(GameObject* obj) {
    obj->move(obj); // Polymorphism: Calls the appropriate move method
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Define the Player Class (Inheritance Simulation)**

The `Player` structure will inherit from `GameObject`, and it will implement its own `move` and `render` methods.

```c
// Player "class" inherits from GameObject
typedef struct Player {
    GameObject base;   // Base class object
    int health;
} Player;

// Player's move behavior
void player_move(GameObject* obj) {
    Player* player = (Player*)obj;
    player->base.x += 1;  // Example: Move player to the right
    printf("Player moved to (%d, %d)\n", player->base.x, player->base.y);
}

// Player's render behavior
void player_render(GameObject* obj) {
    Player* player = (Player*)obj;
    printf("Rendering player at (%d, %d) with health %d\n", player->base.x, player->base.y, player->health);
}

// Function to initialize Player object
void init_player(Player* player, int x, int y, int health) {
    init_game_object(&player->base, x, y, player_move, player_render);
    player->health = health;
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Define the Enemy Class (Inheritance Simulation)**

Similarly, an `Enemy` structure will inherit from `GameObject` and have its own behavior.

```c
// Enemy "class" inherits from GameObject
typedef struct Enemy {
    GameObject base;  // Base class object
    int attack_power;
} Enemy;

// Enemy's move behavior
void enemy_move(GameObject* obj) {
    Enemy* enemy = (Enemy*)obj;
    enemy->base.y += 1;  // Example: Move enemy down
    printf("Enemy moved to (%d, %d)\n", enemy->base.x, enemy->base.y);
}

// Enemy's render behavior
void enemy_render(GameObject* obj) {
    Enemy* enemy = (Enemy*)obj;
    printf("Rendering enemy at (%d, %d) with attack power %d\n", enemy->base.x, enemy->base.y, enemy->attack_power);
}

// Function to initialize Enemy object
void init_enemy(Enemy* enemy, int x, int y, int attack_power) {
    init_game_object(&enemy->base, x, y, enemy_move, enemy_render);
    enemy->attack_power = attack_power;
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Main Game Loop**

Finally, we can create the main game loop, which will create instances of **Player** and **Enemy** objects and simulate the game.

```c
int main() {
    // Create player and enemy objects
    Player player;
    Enemy enemy;
    
    // Initialize player and enemy
    init_player(&player, 0, 0, 100);   // Player starts at (0, 0) with 100 health
    init_enemy(&enemy, 10, 10, 20);    // Enemy starts at (10, 10) with 20 attack power

    // Game loop: Move and render player and enemy
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("\n--- Game Tick %d ---\n", i + 1);
        
        // Move and render player
        move_game_object((GameObject*)&player);
        render_game_object((GameObject*)&player);
        
        // Move and render enemy
        move_game_object((GameObject*)&enemy);
        render_game_object((GameObject*)&enemy);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Key Concepts:**

1. **Inheritance**: 
   - Both `Player` and `Enemy` "inherit" from `GameObject` by embedding it within their own structures. This allows both to share common properties and behaviors like `x`, `y`, `move`, and `render`.

2. **Polymorphism**:
   - The `move` and `render` functions are **function pointers** inside the `GameObject` structure. The player and enemy objects have their own `move` and `render` implementations, and these methods are invoked through the function pointers, which is an example of polymorphism in C.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - We encapsulate the playerâ€™s health and the enemy's attack power within their respective structures. Only the necessary functions (`move` and `render`) interact with these properties.

4. **Game Loop**:
   - The main function runs a game loop where each game object (player and enemy) moves and renders themselves. The `move` and `render` methods are dynamically invoked based on the object type, showcasing polymorphism.

### **Output:**

```text
--- Game Tick 1 ---
Player moved to (1, 0)
Rendering player at (1, 0) with health 100
Enemy moved to (10, 11)
Rendering enemy at (10, 11) with attack power 20

--- Game Tick 2 ---
Player moved to (2, 0)
Rendering player at (2, 0) with health 100
Enemy moved to (10, 12)
Rendering enemy at (10, 12) with attack power 20

--- Game Tick 3 ---
Player moved to (3, 0)
Rendering player at (3, 0) with health 100
Enemy moved to (10, 13)
Rendering enemy at (10, 13) with attack power 20

--- Game Tick 4 ---
Player moved to (4, 0)
Rendering player at (4, 0) with health 100
Enemy moved to (10, 14)
Rendering enemy at (10, 14) with attack power 20

--- Game Tick 5 ---
Player moved to (5, 0)
Rendering player at (5, 0) with health 100
Enemy moved to (10, 15)
Rendering enemy at (10, 15) with attack power 20
```

### **Future Improvements**:
1. **Collision Detection**: Add logic to check if the player and enemy collide and handle interactions.
2. **Extended Object Types**: Add more object types like obstacles, power-ups, etc.
3. **Complex Behaviors**: Add more complex behaviors, such as attacking, using items, and leveling up.
4. **Event Handling**: Implement user input (e.g., arrow keys to move the player).

This framework demonstrates how to simulate object-oriented programming principles in C. By using structures, function pointers, and inheritance-like mechanisms, you can model complex behaviors and game objects, even in a non-OOP language like C.
