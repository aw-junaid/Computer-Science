A comparison of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Procedural Programming** based on key characteristics:  

---

### **1. Paradigm**
- **OOP**:  
  Focuses on objects that encapsulate data and behavior.  
  Example: Classes and objects are the building blocks.  
- **Procedural Programming**:  
  Focuses on sequences of tasks and functions to process data.  
  Example: Code is written as a series of functions or procedures.

---

### **2. Structure**
- **OOP**:  
  Organizes code into classes and objects.  
  Example: A `Car` class with attributes like `color` and `speed` and methods like `start()` and `stop()`.  
- **Procedural Programming**:  
  Organizes code into functions and modules.  
  Example: Separate functions for `start_car()` and `stop_car()`.  

---

### **3. Data and Behavior**
- **OOP**:  
  Combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into objects, promoting encapsulation.  
  Example: An object `dog` has `name` as an attribute and `bark()` as a method.  
- **Procedural Programming**:  
  Data and functions are separate. Functions operate on global or passed data.  
  Example: A function `bark(dog_name)` takes the name of the dog as input.

---

### **4. Code Reusability**
- **OOP**:  
  Supports **inheritance**, allowing child classes to reuse or override parent class code.  
  Example: A `Vehicle` class can be inherited by `Car` and `Bike` classes.  
- **Procedural Programming**:  
  Encourages code reuse through modular functions, but lacks inheritance.  
  Example: Functions can be reused but need to be manually adapted for related use cases.

---

### **5. Abstraction**
- **OOP**:  
  Allows hiding implementation details using abstraction and interfaces.  
  Example: The user interacts with a `start()` method without knowing the underlying implementation.  
- **Procedural Programming**:  
  Does not inherently support abstraction; all implementation details may be visible.  

---

### **6. Scalability**
- **OOP**:  
  Highly scalable due to modular and hierarchical structure.  
  Example: Large software systems like GUI applications are easier to manage.  
- **Procedural Programming**:  
  Can become complex and difficult to maintain as the codebase grows.  

---

### **7. Maintainability**
- **OOP**:  
  Easier to maintain due to encapsulation and modular design. Changes in one part of the code are less likely to impact other parts.  
- **Procedural Programming**:  
  Can be harder to maintain because functions and global data are tightly coupled.  

---

### **8. Example**
#### **OOP Example (Python)**:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.sound())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

#### **Procedural Programming Example (Python)**:
```python
def dog_sound(name):
    return f"{name} says Woof!"

print(dog_sound("Buddy"))  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

---

### **When to Use OOP vs Procedural Programming**
- Use **OOP** for large, complex, and scalable systems where reusability, maintainability, and abstraction are critical.  
- Use **Procedural Programming** for small scripts or tasks where simplicity and speed of implementation are prioritized.
