### **Class Variables vs. Instance Variables in Ruby**

In Ruby, **class variables** and **instance variables** are used to store data, but they behave differently in terms of their scope and how they are shared within a class. Let’s dive deeper into each type of variable and understand their differences.

---

### **1. Instance Variables**

An **instance variable** is a variable that is associated with a specific instance of a class. Each object (instance) of the class has its own copy of instance variables.

#### **Key Characteristics of Instance Variables:**
- Defined with an `@` prefix (e.g., `@name`).
- Each instance of a class has its own unique value for instance variables.
- Instance variables are accessible only within the instance of the class they belong to.
- They are typically used to store the state or attributes of an object.

#### **Example: Instance Variables**

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name  # Instance variable for name
    @age = age    # Instance variable for age
  end

  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

person1 = Person.new("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person.new("Bob", 25)

person1.introduce  # Outputs: Hi, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
person2.introduce  # Outputs: Hi, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.
```

- **Explanation**: In the `Person` class, `@name` and `@age` are instance variables. Each object (`person1` and `person2`) has its own values for these instance variables.

### **2. Class Variables**

A **class variable** is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class, as well as the class itself. It is defined with a `@@` prefix (e.g., `@@count`).

#### **Key Characteristics of Class Variables:**
- Defined with a `@@` prefix (e.g., `@@count`).
- Shared among all instances of the class and the class itself.
- Can be used to store data that is common to all instances of a class (e.g., counting the number of instances).
- Changes to a class variable affect all instances of the class.

#### **Example: Class Variables**

```ruby
class Person
  @@count = 0  # Class variable to keep track of the number of instances

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @@count += 1  # Increment class variable when a new instance is created
  end

  def self.count
    @@count  # Class method to return the count
  end
end

person1 = Person.new("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person.new("Bob", 25)

puts Person.count  # Outputs: 2 (Total number of Person instances)
```

- **Explanation**: Here, `@@count` is a class variable shared by all instances of the `Person` class. Each time a new instance is created, the `@@count` variable is incremented, and it reflects the total number of instances.

### **3. Differences Between Class Variables and Instance Variables**

| **Aspect**                | **Instance Variables**                              | **Class Variables**                              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Prefix**                | `@` (e.g., `@name`)                                 | `@@` (e.g., `@@count`)                           |
| **Scope**                 | Belongs to individual instances (objects).         | Shared across all instances and the class itself.|
| **Access**                | Can only be accessed within the instance they belong to. | Accessible by both instances and the class itself.|
| **Usage**                 | Stores object-specific data or state.               | Stores class-specific data or state shared by all instances.|
| **Behavior**              | Changes to instance variables affect only that instance. | Changes to class variables affect all instances and the class itself. |
| **Default Values**        | Not initialized by default; must be set in `initialize` method or elsewhere. | Initialized by default for all instances of the class. |

### **4. Example: Class Variables Affecting All Instances**

```ruby
class Vehicle
  @@total_vehicles = 0  # Class variable to track total vehicles created

  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make    # Instance variable
    @model = model  # Instance variable
    @@total_vehicles += 1  # Increment class variable when a new instance is created
  end

  def self.total_vehicles
    @@total_vehicles  # Class method to return the total vehicle count
  end
end

car1 = Vehicle.new("Toyota", "Corolla")
car2 = Vehicle.new("Honda", "Civic")

puts Vehicle.total_vehicles  # Outputs: 2 (Shared by all Vehicle instances)
```

- **Explanation**: In this example, the class variable `@@total_vehicles` is shared across all instances of the `Vehicle` class. Every time a new instance is created, `@@total_vehicles` is incremented. This variable is accessible both from within instances and from the class itself.

---

### **5. Class Variables in Inheritance**

Class variables are inherited by subclasses, but they are shared between the parent class and its subclasses. This can lead to some unexpected behavior when working with inheritance.

#### **Example: Class Variables in Inheritance**

```ruby
class Animal
  @@species_count = 0

  def initialize
    @@species_count += 1
  end

  def self.species_count
    @@species_count
  end
end

class Dog < Animal; end
class Cat < Animal; end

dog = Dog.new
cat = Cat.new

puts Animal.species_count  # Outputs: 2 (Shared class variable between Animal, Dog, and Cat)
```

- **Explanation**: `@@species_count` is shared between the parent class (`Animal`) and its subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`). When an instance of `Dog` or `Cat` is created, `@@species_count` is incremented, affecting the count for all classes.

---

### **6. Instance Variables vs. Class Variables in the Context of Inheritance**

While instance variables are unique to each object, class variables are shared across the entire class hierarchy (parent and child classes). This means that subclass instances can also modify the class variable from the parent class, which may not always be the desired behavior.

#### **Example: Inheritance and Class Variables**

```ruby
class Parent
  @@value = "Parent's Value"

  def self.value
    @@value
  end
end

class Child < Parent
  def self.change_value
    @@value = "Child's Value"
  end
end

puts Parent.value  # Outputs: Parent's Value
Child.change_value
puts Parent.value  # Outputs: Child's Value (Class variable is shared)
```

- **Explanation**: The class variable `@@value` is shared across both `Parent` and `Child` classes. Changing it in the `Child` class also affects the `Parent` class.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

- **Instance Variables**:
  - Unique to each instance of a class.
  - Typically used to store object-specific data.
  - Accessed using the `@` prefix.
  
- **Class Variables**:
  - Shared across all instances of a class and the class itself.
  - Typically used for class-level data or behaviors.
  - Accessed using the `@@` prefix.

In general, **instance variables** are more commonly used, as they help encapsulate data at the object level, while **class variables** are useful for tracking data or behaviors shared by all instances of a class. However, class variables can lead to issues when used in inheritance, so it’s essential to consider their impact carefully.
