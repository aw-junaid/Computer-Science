**Authorization** in Postman refers to the process of proving the identity of the user or system making a request to an API. This step is crucial for ensuring that only authorized users can access or manipulate the API resources. Postman provides several authorization mechanisms to help with different types of API security.

### Types of Authorization in Postman:

1. **No Auth**:
   - If the API doesn’t require any form of authorization, you can simply choose **No Auth**.
   - **Use Case**: Public APIs or APIs that allow unauthenticated access.

2. **Basic Auth**:
   - Basic Authentication is one of the simplest forms of authorization, where the client sends a username and password encoded in the HTTP request.
   - **How It Works**: The client sends a `username:password` pair, which is then encoded into a Base64 string and included in the request header.
   - **Postman Setup**:
     - In the **Authorization** tab, select **Basic Auth**.
     - Enter the **Username** and **Password** fields.
     - Postman will automatically encode the credentials and include the `Authorization: Basic <encoded_credentials>` header in the request.

3. **Bearer Token**:
   - A bearer token is a type of access token that is often used with OAuth2 or other token-based authentication schemes.
   - **How It Works**: A bearer token is issued to the client (usually by an authentication server) after a user logs in. This token is sent in the HTTP header to authenticate API requests.
   - **Postman Setup**:
     - In the **Authorization** tab, select **Bearer Token**.
     - Enter the **Token** field with the value of the access token (e.g., `xyz123456abc`).
     - Postman will add the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header automatically.

4. **OAuth 1.0**:
   - OAuth 1.0 is an older authentication standard that allows third-party applications to securely access a service on behalf of a user.
   - **How It Works**: OAuth 1.0 uses consumer keys, secret keys, and other credentials to sign the request.
   - **Postman Setup**:
     - In the **Authorization** tab, select **OAuth 1.0**.
     - Provide the required credentials, such as **Consumer Key**, **Consumer Secret**, **Access Token**, and **Access Token Secret**.
     - Postman will handle the signature process and include the necessary OAuth headers in the request.

5. **OAuth 2.0**:
   - OAuth 2.0 is a more modern and widely used authorization framework. It allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a user or to access a system’s resources.
   - **How It Works**: OAuth 2.0 flows often involve obtaining an **Authorization Code**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**, followed by exchanging the code for an **Access Token**.
   - **Postman Setup**:
     - In the **Authorization** tab, select **OAuth 2.0**.
     - Click on **Get New Access Token**.
     - Enter the **Token Name**, **Auth URL**, **Access Token URL**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and other necessary details.
     - Click **Request Token** to obtain an access token.
     - Once you have the token, Postman will include it in the `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.
     - Optionally, you can set **Token Expiry** and **Refresh Token** to manage token renewal.

6. **API Key**:
   - Some APIs require an **API Key** to authenticate requests. The API key is usually passed either in the query parameter or in the header.
   - **How It Works**: An API key is provided to the user by the API service, and it is included in every request to authenticate it.
   - **Postman Setup**:
     - In the **Authorization** tab, select **API Key**.
     - Choose where the key should be sent: as a query parameter or in the header.
     - Enter the **Key** (the name of the API key, like `x-api-key`) and the **Value** (your actual API key).
     - Postman will automatically include the `x-api-key: <your_api_key>` in the request header or as a query parameter based on your selection.

7. **Digest Auth**:
   - Digest Authentication is a more secure form of Basic Authentication, using hashing algorithms to encode credentials.
   - **How It Works**: The client sends a hashed version of the username, password, and other parameters, such as a nonce, to the server for validation.
   - **Postman Setup**:
     - In the **Authorization** tab, select **Digest Auth**.
     - Enter the **Username**, **Password**, and any additional parameters if needed (such as **Realm**, **Nonce**, etc.).
     - Postman will automatically send the hashed version of the credentials.

8. **Hawk Authentication**:
   - Hawk is a security protocol for authenticating HTTP requests. It requires a key and a few other data points, such as a nonce and timestamp.
   - **How It Works**: Hawk signs each request with a key to prove authenticity, ensuring the integrity and origin of the request.
   - **Postman Setup**:
     - In the **Authorization** tab, select **Hawk**.
     - Provide necessary information such as **Client Id**, **Client Key**, and **Timestamp**.
     - Postman will generate the signature and include it in the `Authorization` header.

### Steps to Set Authorization in Postman:

1. **Select the Authorization Type**:
   - Open Postman and go to the request you want to authorize.
   - Navigate to the **Authorization** tab.
   - From the **Type** dropdown, select the appropriate authorization type (e.g., **Bearer Token**, **Basic Auth**, **OAuth 2.0**).

2. **Enter Required Credentials**:
   - Depending on the selected authorization type, enter the necessary credentials, such as API keys, usernames, passwords, or tokens.
   
3. **Send the Request**:
   - Once the authorization is set, send the request. Postman will automatically attach the appropriate authorization headers to your request.

### Example of Authorization in Postman:
1. **Basic Auth**:
   - Select **Basic Auth** in the Authorization tab.
   - Enter `username` and `password`.
   - Postman will add the header: `Authorization: Basic <encoded_credentials>`.

2. **Bearer Token**:
   - Select **Bearer Token** in the Authorization tab.
   - Enter the token in the **Token** field.
   - Postman will add the header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

### Conclusion:
Authorization in Postman is essential for interacting with secure APIs. By selecting the appropriate authorization method (Basic Auth, Bearer Token, OAuth 2.0, etc.), you ensure that your requests are properly authenticated. Postman offers a wide range of authentication mechanisms to cover the security needs of different APIs, making it a powerful tool for developers working with web services.
