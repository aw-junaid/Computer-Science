In C#, data types are used to define the type of data a variable can hold. C# is a statically typed language, meaning the type of each variable must be defined at compile time. C# supports a rich set of built-in data types that can be categorized into **value types** and **reference types**.

### 1. **Value Types**
Value types hold data directly. When you assign a value type variable to another, a copy of the value is created. Value types include primitive types (like `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.) and structures (like `struct`).

#### **Primitive Types (Built-In Value Types)**

- **Integer Types**: Used for whole numbers.
  - `byte`: 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255)
  - `short`: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
  - `int`: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
  - `long`: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)

  ```csharp
  byte b = 255;
  short s = 32000;
  int i = 123456;
  long l = 123456789012345;
  ```

- **Floating Point Types**: Used for decimal numbers.
  - `float`: 32-bit single precision floating-point number (±1.5 × 10^−45 to ±3.4 × 10^38)
  - `double`: 64-bit double precision floating-point number (±5.0 × 10^−324 to ±1.7 × 10^308)
  - `decimal`: 128-bit high-precision decimal (used for financial calculations)

  ```csharp
  float f = 3.14f;
  double d = 3.14159;
  decimal m = 12345.6789m;
  ```

- **Character Type**:
  - `char`: 16-bit Unicode character (a single character)

  ```csharp
  char letter = 'A';
  ```

- **Boolean Type**:
  - `bool`: Represents a value of `true` or `false`.

  ```csharp
  bool isActive = true;
  ```

#### **Special Numeric Types**
- **`var`**: A special type that allows C# to infer the type based on the assigned value. It is still strongly typed, but the compiler determines the type.
  
  ```csharp
  var x = 10; // inferred as int
  var y = 3.14; // inferred as double
  ```

### 2. **Reference Types**
Reference types hold a reference (or address) to the data rather than the data itself. When a reference type variable is assigned to another, both variables refer to the same object in memory.

#### **String**
- `string`: Represents a sequence of characters (text). It is a reference type, but it behaves somewhat like a value type due to its immutable nature.

  ```csharp
  string name = "John Doe";
  ```

#### **Object**
- `object`: The base type for all types in C#. Every type (including primitive types, classes, arrays, and more) inherits from `object`. It can hold any type of data, but you may need to cast it back to the original type when retrieving the value.

  ```csharp
  object obj = 123; // Can store any type of data
  obj = "Hello, World!";
  ```

#### **Arrays**
- Arrays in C# are reference types and can hold multiple values of the same data type.

  ```csharp
  int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; // Array of integers
  string[] fruits = { "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry" }; // Array of strings
  ```

### 3. **Nullable Types**
In C#, value types cannot represent `null` unless they are explicitly marked as nullable. You can make a value type nullable by using the `?` symbol.

- **Nullable Value Types**: Used when you want a value type to hold `null` as a possible value.

  ```csharp
  int? nullableInt = null; // Nullable integer
  bool? nullableBool = null; // Nullable boolean
  ```

### 4. **Enum Types**
An **enum** (short for "enumeration") is a distinct type defined by a set of named constants. By default, the underlying type of an enum is `int`, but you can specify a different numeric type.

```csharp
enum Day { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday }
Day today = Day.Monday;
```

- **Enum Syntax**:
  ```csharp
  enum EnumName { Value1, Value2, Value3, ... }
  ```

You can also explicitly set the underlying values:
```csharp
enum Day { Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 3, Wednesday = 4 }
```

### 5. **Struct Types**
A **struct** is a value type that is similar to a class but is typically used to define small, lightweight objects. Structs are useful for performance-sensitive code, as they are stored on the stack rather than the heap.

```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}

Point p = new Point();
p.X = 10;
p.Y = 20;
```

### 6. **Tuple Types**
Tuples allow you to group multiple values of different types into a single object. This can be useful for returning multiple values from a method.

```csharp
var tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14);
Console.WriteLine(tuple.Item1);  // Output: 1
Console.WriteLine(tuple.Item2);  // Output: Hello
Console.WriteLine(tuple.Item3);  // Output: 3.14
```

- **Named Tuples**:
  ```csharp
  var namedTuple = (Id: 1, Name: "John", Age: 30);
  Console.WriteLine(namedTuple.Name); // Output: John
  ```

### 7. **Dynamic Type**
The `dynamic` type in C# bypasses compile-time type checking. Variables of type `dynamic` can hold any type of data, and type resolution happens at runtime.

```csharp
dynamic variable = 10;
Console.WriteLine(variable); // Output: 10
variable = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(variable); // Output: Hello
```
