MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that was created as a fork of MySQL by the original developers of MySQL after Oracle's acquisition of MySQL. MariaDB is designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL, meaning it retains compatibility with MySQL but comes with additional features, improvements, and optimizations.
