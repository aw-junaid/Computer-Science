### **2. JUnit**
**JUnit** is a popular testing framework for Java applications, primarily used for unit testing.

#### **Key Features**
- **Annotations**:
  - Use annotations like `@Test`, `@Before`, `@After` to define test cases and setup/teardown methods.
- **Assertions**:
  - Provides assertion methods to validate expected outcomes.
- **Test Runners**:
  - Execute test cases using test runners.
- **Integration**:
  - Integrates with build tools like Maven and Gradle.

#### **Use Cases**
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components or methods in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate interactions between components.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure code changes do not introduce new bugs.

#### **Pros**
- Simple and easy to use.
- Strong integration with Java development tools.
- Widely adopted in the Java community.

#### **Cons**
- Primarily designed for unit testing.
- Limited support for other programming languages.

### **3. TestNG**
**TestNG** is a testing framework inspired by JUnit but designed to cover a broader range of test categories, including unit, functional, and end-to-end testing.

#### **Key Features**
- **Annotations**:
  - Supports advanced annotations like `@BeforeSuite`, `@AfterSuite`, `@DataProvider`.
- **Parallel Execution**:
  - Allows parallel execution of test cases.
- **Parameterization**:
  - Supports parameterized tests using `@DataProvider`.
- **Test Grouping**:
  - Group test cases and execute them selectively.
- **Integration**:
  - Integrates with tools like Maven, Jenkins, and Selenium.

#### **Use Cases**
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components or methods.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate interactions between components.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Automate user workflows across multiple components.
- **Performance Testing**: Execute load and stress tests.

#### **Pros**
- More flexible and powerful than JUnit.
- Supports parallel execution and parameterization.
- Strong integration with Selenium for web testing.

#### **Cons**
- Steeper learning curve compared to JUnit.
- Primarily focused on Java.
