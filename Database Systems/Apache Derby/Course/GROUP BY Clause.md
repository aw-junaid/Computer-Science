In Apache Derby, the `GROUP BY` clause is used in conjunction with aggregate functions (such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. This is particularly useful for performing aggregation on subsets of data.

### Basic Syntax for `GROUP BY`
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;
```
- **`column1, column2, ...`**: The columns you want to group by.
- **`aggregate_function(column_name)`**: The aggregate function (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) that performs a calculation on each group.
- **`WHERE`**: (Optional) A condition to filter rows before grouping.
- **`GROUP BY`**: The column(s) you want to group the results by.

### Example 1: Simple `GROUP BY` with `COUNT`
You can use the `COUNT` aggregate function to find the number of rows in each group.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```
- This query returns the number of employees in each department by grouping the rows based on `department_id`.

### Example 2: Using `SUM` with `GROUP BY`
The `SUM` function calculates the total sum of a specified numeric column for each group.

```sql
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```
- This query returns the total salary of employees in each department by grouping rows based on `department_id`.

### Example 3: Using `AVG` with `GROUP BY`
The `AVG` function calculates the average value of a specified numeric column for each group.

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```
- This query returns the average salary of employees in each department.

### Example 4: Using `MIN` and `MAX` with `GROUP BY`
You can use the `MIN` and `MAX` functions to find the minimum and maximum values within each group.

```sql
SELECT department_id, MIN(salary), MAX(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```
- This query returns the minimum and maximum salary for employees in each department.

### Example 5: Grouping by Multiple Columns
You can group by multiple columns to create more granular groups.

```sql
SELECT department_id, job_title, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id, job_title;
```
- This query returns the number of employees in each department, grouped by both `department_id` and `job_title`.

### Example 6: Using `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`
The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause. This is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but `HAVING` is used to filter groups, while `WHERE` filters individual rows before grouping.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```
- This query returns the departments that have more than 10 employees.

### Example 7: Grouping with `DISTINCT` and `GROUP BY`
You can use the `DISTINCT` keyword in combination with `GROUP BY` to remove duplicate rows before grouping.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department_id
FROM employees;
```
- This query retrieves unique department IDs from the `employees` table.

### Example 8: Combining `GROUP BY` with Other Clauses
You can use `GROUP BY` in combination with `ORDER BY` to sort the grouped results.

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC;
```
- This query returns the average salary for each department, ordered by the average salary in descending order.

### Example 9: Grouping with `NULL` Values
When you group by a column, `NULL` values are treated as a separate group. For example, if you have a column with some `NULL` values, those rows will be grouped together.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```
- If some rows have a `NULL` value for `department_id`, those rows will be grouped together under `NULL`.

### Example 10: Using `GROUP BY` in Subqueries
You can use the `GROUP BY` clause in subqueries for more complex aggregations.

```sql
SELECT department_id, (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.department_id) AS avg_salary
FROM departments d;
```
- This query finds the average salary for each department by using a subquery within the `SELECT` statement.

### Important Notes:
1. **Columns in `SELECT` Clause**: Any column that is not part of an aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.
2. **`HAVING` vs. `WHERE`**: The `WHERE` clause filters rows before grouping, while the `HAVING` clause filters groups after aggregation.
3. **Order of Clauses**: The typical order of SQL clauses when using `GROUP BY` is `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`.

### Conclusion
The `GROUP BY` clause in Apache Derby is a powerful tool for performing aggregation on subsets of data. It allows you to group rows based on one or more columns and then apply aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`. When combined with the `HAVING` clause, it enables filtering of aggregated results.
