### **IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) and EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)**

Both **IGP** and **EGP** are types of routing protocols that play essential roles in how routing information is exchanged across networks. The primary difference between the two lies in their scope: **IGPs** are used within an autonomous system (AS), while **EGPs** are used for routing between autonomous systems.

---

### **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)**

**IGPs** are used for routing within a single Autonomous System (AS), which is a collection of networks and routers under the same administrative control. IGPs enable routers within an AS to share routing information and make dynamic routing decisions based on the network's topology.

#### **Common IGPs:**

1. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**  
   - **Type**: Distance-vector protocol.
   - **Metric**: Hop count.
   - **Versions**:
     - **RIP v1**: Classful routing (no support for subnet masks).
     - **RIP v2**: Classless routing (supports variable-length subnet masking - VLSM).
   - **Limitations**: Maximum hop count of 15 (i.e., any destination 16 hops away is considered unreachable).
   - **Use Case**: Small to medium-sized networks.

   **Command (Cisco)**:
   ```bash
   router rip
   version 2
   network 192.168.1.0
   ```

2. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**  
   - **Type**: Link-state protocol.
   - **Metric**: Cost (based on bandwidth).
   - **Features**:
     - Uses **LSA (Link-State Advertisements)** to share information.
     - **Areas** for hierarchical routing (e.g., backbone area 0).
     - Converges faster than RIP.
   - **Use Case**: Larger networks with multiple subnets.

   **Command (Cisco)**:
   ```bash
   router ospf 1
   network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
   ```

3. **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**  
   - **Type**: Hybrid protocol (combines aspects of both distance-vector and link-state protocols).
   - **Metric**: Based on bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and MTU.
   - **Features**:
     - **Fast convergence** and efficient use of network resources.
     - Cisco proprietary.
   - **Use Case**: Medium to large enterprise networks.

   **Command (Cisco)**:
   ```bash
   router eigrp 100
   network 192.168.1.0
   ```

4. **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**  
   - **Type**: Link-state protocol.
   - **Metric**: Cost (similar to OSPF).
   - **Features**:
     - Primarily used in large service provider networks.
     - Scalable and flexible.
   - **Use Case**: Large, complex networks (e.g., ISPs).

### **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)**

**EGPs** are used to route data between different Autonomous Systems (ASes) on the internet or between large organizations. EGPs exchange routing information between networks administered by different entities (e.g., ISPs, enterprises). 

#### **Common EGPs:**

1. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**  
   - **Type**: Path-vector protocol.
   - **Metric**: AS path (the sequence of ASes through which data passes).
   - **Features**:
     - **BGP-4**: The most common version, supports Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).
     - Can carry multiple types of routing information, including route aggregation, policy-based routing, and load balancing.
     - **BGP Peering**: Routers exchange routing information through BGP peering relationships.
   - **Use Case**: Internet routing, large-scale enterprise networks.

   **Command (Cisco)**:
   ```bash
   router bgp 65001
   neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65002
   network 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0
   ```

2. **EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)**  
   - **Type**: Older and simpler distance-vector protocol (not commonly used today).
   - **Metric**: Hop count (similar to RIP).
   - **Features**: The predecessor to BGP. It has been largely replaced by BGP due to limitations in scalability and functionality.
   - **Use Case**: Previously used for routing between different ASes in the 1980s and 1990s.

### **When to Use IGP vs. EGP**

#### **Use IGPs**:
- For routing within an organization or a single network domain (Autonomous System).
- When you need fast convergence and simple network management.
- In smaller to medium-sized networks that do not require external communication beyond a single AS.

#### **Use EGPs**:
- For routing between different Autonomous Systems (e.g., between different ISPs or large organizations).
- When managing large-scale internet traffic or connecting multiple organizations.
- For inter-domain routing, where policy-based routing and network path control are necessary.

---

### **Example Scenario:**
- **IGP**: A company with multiple branches uses **OSPF** within its network. Each branch router shares routing information to efficiently route traffic within the company’s internal network.
- **EGP**: The same company connects to the internet via an **ISP**, and uses **BGP** to exchange routing information between its network and the ISP’s network, ensuring efficient routing of external traffic.
