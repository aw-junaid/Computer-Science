  - Available in most residential and commercial areas.

- **Limitations**:
  - Shared bandwidth can lead to performance issues.
  - Not ideal for high-security applications.

### **6. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)**

- **Description**:
  - A cell-based switching technology that segments data into fixed-size cells.
  - Suitable for voice, video, and data traffic.

- **Key Features**:
  - Uses fixed 53-byte cells for efficient and predictable performance.
  - Provides Quality of Service (QoS) for real-time applications.

- **Advantages**:
  - Reliable for multimedia traffic.
  - Can handle high-speed traffic.

- **Limitations**:
  - Expensive compared to Ethernet-based WANs.
  - Largely replaced by MPLS and IP-based solutions.

### **7. SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN)**

- **Description**:
  - A modern WAN technology that uses software to manage and optimize data traffic across multiple connection types (e.g., broadband, MPLS, LTE).

- **Key Features**:
  - Centralized management and control.
  - Dynamic path selection for optimal performance.

- **Advantages**:
  - Cost-effective compared to MPLS.
  - Scalable and flexible for cloud and hybrid environments.

- **Limitations**:
  - Initial setup can be complex.
  - Dependent on reliable internet connections.

---

### **8. Satellite**

- **Description**:
  - Provides global connectivity by transmitting data via orbiting satellites.
  - Ideal for remote or rural areas without terrestrial infrastructure.

- **Advantages**:
  - Global coverage, including remote regions.
  - Rapid deployment in disaster recovery scenarios.

- **Limitations**:
  - High latency due to the distance signals travel.
  - Expensive compared to terrestrial technologies.

---

### **9. Cellular WAN (3G, 4G LTE, 5G)**

- **Description**:
  - Uses cellular networks for WAN connectivity, supporting mobility and IoT applications.

- **Advantages**:
  - Widely available and scalable.
  - Supports mobile devices and IoT integration.

- **Limitations**:
  - Bandwidth and latency depend on carrier and network conditions.
  - Limited coverage in some rural areas.

---

### **10. VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

- **Description**:
  - Extends a private network across a public network (e.g., the internet) using encrypted tunnels.
  - Commonly used for secure remote access and site-to-site connections.

- **Advantages**:
  - Cost-effective and secure.
  - Easy to implement over existing internet connections.

- **Limitations**:
  - Dependent on the underlying internet connection's reliability.
  - Performance may degrade with high latency or bandwidth constraints.
