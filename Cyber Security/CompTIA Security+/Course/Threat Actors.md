### **Threat Actors**

**Threat actors** refer to individuals or groups who deliberately seek to compromise the security of systems, networks, and data. These actors employ a variety of techniques, tools, and methods to exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes. The term "threat actor" is often used in the cybersecurity field to describe anyone involved in a cyberattack, including hackers, cybercriminals, state-sponsored entities, and even insiders.

Threat actors can vary widely in terms of motivations, capabilities, and targets. Understanding the different types of threat actors is crucial for organizations to develop effective cybersecurity strategies and defenses.

   - **Definition**: These threat actors are affiliated with nation-states and conduct cyber operations that support national interests, including espionage, sabotage, and warfare.
   - **Motivation**: Political, military, economic, and strategic objectives, such as intelligence gathering, espionage, or disrupting an adversary's infrastructure.
   - **Common Tactics**:
     - **Espionage**: Attacks on foreign governments, corporations, or institutions to steal sensitive data, intellectual property, or national secrets.
     - **Disruption**: Disabling critical infrastructure, such as power grids, financial systems, or communications networks, to destabilize an adversary.
     - **Propaganda and Influence Operations**: Using cyber tools to spread misinformation, disinformation, or propaganda to manipulate public opinion, sway elections, or create social unrest.

4. **Hacktivists**:
   - **Definition**: Hacktivists are individuals or groups who use hacking as a form of protest or to advance a political or social agenda.
   - **Motivation**: Political, ideological, or social causes, such as promoting human rights, environmental protection, or anti-government movements.
   - **Common Tactics**:
     - **Website Defacement**: Altering or defacing websites to spread a political message or draw attention to a cause.
     - **DDoS Attacks**: Launching distributed denial-of-service attacks against targets that the hacktivists believe are unethical or oppressive.
     - **Data Leaks**: Exposing sensitive or confidential information to the public to expose wrongdoing or highlight issues of social justice.

5. **Insiders (Insider Threats)**:
   - **Definition**: Insiders are individuals within an organization, such as employees, contractors, or business partners, who exploit their access to systems, networks, or data for malicious purposes.
   - **Motivation**: Financial gain, revenge, disgruntlement, or ideological motives.
   - **Common Tactics**:
     - **Data Theft**: Stealing sensitive data, intellectual property, or trade secrets from the organization.
     - **Sabotage**: Deliberately damaging systems, applications, or data, such as introducing malware or deleting files.
     - **Espionage**: Leaking confidential company information to competitors, adversaries, or the public.
   - **Types of Insider Threats**:
     - **Malicious Insiders**: Employees or contractors who intentionally harm the organization for personal gain or due to negative motivations.
     - **Negligent Insiders**: Employees who inadvertently expose the organization to risk due to careless behavior, such as falling for phishing scams or mismanaging sensitive data.
     - **Compromised Insiders**: Employees who are unknowingly manipulated by external actors (e.g., through social engineering) to conduct malicious activities.

6. **Criminal Organizations**:
   - **Definition**: Organized crime groups that use cyber tools and techniques to engage in illicit activities, often on a large scale.
   - **Motivation**: Profit, power, and illegal activities.
   - **Common Tactics**:
     - **Ransomware-as-a-Service**: Providing ransomware tools to other criminals or groups in exchange for a share of the profits.
     - **Money Laundering**: Using cryptocurrency or other methods to launder illicit profits obtained through cybercrime.
     - **Fraud and Identity Theft**: Stealing personal or financial data to commit fraud, such as through credit card fraud or illegal loans.

7. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**:
   - **Definition**: APTs are highly skilled, well-funded, and persistent threat actors, often sponsored by nation-states, that engage in long-term, stealthy campaigns to infiltrate and gather intelligence or disrupt critical operations.
   - **Motivation**: Espionage, intellectual property theft, military or strategic advantage, and infrastructure sabotage.
   - **Common Tactics**:
     - **Stealthy Infiltration**: APTs often use sophisticated methods, such as spear-phishing emails or zero-day vulnerabilities, to gain access to target networks.
     - **Lateral Movement**: Once inside the network, APT actors use advanced techniques to move between systems undetected and gather sensitive information.
     - **Data Exfiltration**: Stealing large amounts of data over time without alerting the victim.

8. **Script Kiddies**:
   - **Definition**: These are individuals, often inexperienced and unskilled, who use pre-written hacking tools or scripts to launch attacks. They typically lack deep technical knowledge but are motivated by curiosity, peer pressure, or the desire to cause harm.
   - **Motivation**: Fun, recognition, and sometimes personal vendettas.
   - **Common Tactics**:
