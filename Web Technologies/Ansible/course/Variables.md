### **Ansible Variables**

Ansible variables allow you to store data that can be used throughout your playbooks, roles, and tasks. Variables help you create more dynamic and reusable playbooks, as they enable you to configure systems differently based on various conditions (e.g., target host, environment, or task-specific parameters).

### **Types of Ansible Variables**

1. **Playbook Variables**  
   These are defined in the playbook itself using the `vars` section. They are accessible only within the playbook.

   Example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install Apache Web Server
     hosts: web_servers
     vars:
       apache_package: httpd
     tasks:
       - name: Install Apache
         ansible.builtin.yum:
           name: "{{ apache_package }}"
           state: present
   ```

2. **Inventory Variables**  
   These variables are defined in the inventory file. Inventory variables can be set for groups or individual hosts.

   Example (in an **inventory** file):
   ```ini
   [web_servers]
   web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 apache_port=80
   web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 apache_port=8080
   ```

3. **Host Variables**  
   Host-specific variables can be defined in the `host_vars/` directory. These variables apply to a specific host.

   Example: A file `host_vars/web1.yml`:
   ```yaml
   apache_port: 80
   ```

4. **Group Variables**  
   Group-specific variables can be defined in the `group_vars/` directory. These variables apply to all hosts in a specific group.

   Example: A file `group_vars/web_servers.yml`:
   ```yaml
   apache_port: 80
   ```

5. **Command-line Variables**  
   Variables can be passed at runtime using the `-e` or `--extra-vars` flag on the command line.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml -e "apache_port=8080"
   ```

6. **Registered Variables**  
   You can register the result of a task into a variable to use it later in the playbook.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Gather disk information
     hosts: localhost
     tasks:
       - name: Get disk usage
         ansible.builtin.command: df -h
         register: disk_usage

       - name: Show disk usage
         debug:
           msg: "{{ disk_usage.stdout }}"
   ```

7. **Facts**  
   Ansible automatically gathers facts about the managed hosts (such as the OS, memory, and network interfaces) during execution. These facts are available as variables and can be used in tasks.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Show system info
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Display OS family
         debug:
           msg: "The OS family is {{ ansible_facts['os_family'] }}"
   ```

8. **Defaults in Roles**  
   Roles can define default variables in the `defaults/main.yml` file, which are overridden by variables from the playbook or inventory.

   Example: `roles/apache/defaults/main.yml`
   ```yaml
   ---
   apache_port: 80
   ```

---

### **Accessing Variables in Ansible**

Variables are referenced in Ansible playbooks using the `{{ variable_name }}` syntax.

Examples:

- **Simple variable access**:
  ```yaml
  apache_package: httpd

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: "{{ apache_package }}"
        state: present
  ```

- **Accessing dictionary values**:
  If a variable is a dictionary, you can access its values like this:
  ```yaml
  my_dict:
    apache_port: 80
    apache_user: apache_user

  tasks:
    - name: Show Apache port
      debug:
        msg: "The Apache port is {{ my_dict.apache_port }}"
  ```

- **Accessing list values**:
  If a variable is a list, you can access its elements using indices:
  ```yaml
  my_list:
    - httpd
    - nginx

  tasks:
    - name: Show first item in the list
      debug:
        msg: "The first web server is {{ my_list[0] }}"
  ```

### **Variable Precedence in Ansible**

Ansible has a well-defined precedence order for variables. When multiple sources define the same variable, Ansible uses the variable from the highest precedence source.

Hereâ€™s the variable precedence from lowest to highest:

1. **Role defaults** (`defaults/main.yml`)  
   Lowest priority. These values can be overridden by other higher-priority sources.

2. **Inventory variables**  
   Defined in inventory files or inventory group files.

3. **Playbook variables**  
   Defined within a playbook under `vars`, `vars_files`, or `extra_vars`.

4. **Host and Group variables**  
   Variables stored in `host_vars/` or `group_vars/` directories have higher precedence than playbook variables.

5. **Command-line variables** (`-e` or `--extra-vars`)  
   Command-line variables set with the `-e` flag have the highest priority. They can override any other variable.

### **Using Variables in Templates**

You can also use variables in **Jinja2 templates**. Jinja2 allows you to dynamically generate files, configurations, or scripts based on variable values.

Example: `httpd.conf.j2` (Jinja2 template for Apache configuration)
```jinja
Listen {{ apache_port }}
<VirtualHost *:{{ apache_port }}>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
</VirtualHost>
```

This template can be used in a playbook to generate an Apache configuration file dynamically:

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Apache configuration
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy Apache config file
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: httpd.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/httpd.conf
```

---

### **Best Practices for Using Variables**

1. **Use Meaningful Names**: Give variables descriptive and meaningful names to make your playbooks easier to read and understand.
   
2. **Group Variables**: When managing multiple hosts or groups, define variables in `group_vars/` or `host_vars/` for better organization.

3. **Default Variables in Roles**: Use `defaults/main.yml` in roles to provide default values that can be easily overridden.

4. **Avoid Hardcoding**: Avoid hardcoding values within tasks. Use variables to make your playbooks flexible and reusable.

5. **Use `vars_files` for Large Variables**: If you have large sets of variables, consider using external YAML files and include them using the `vars_files` directive.

6. **Document Variables**: Make sure you document the variables used in your playbooks, especially when they are part of roles or inventories, so that others can understand their purpose and usage.

### **Conclusion**

Ansible variables are a fundamental part of automating and configuring your infrastructure. They allow you to customize configurations dynamically, manage multiple environments, and make your playbooks more modular and reusable. By understanding the different ways to define and use variables, and following best practices, you can improve the flexibility, readability, and maintainability of your Ansible automation.
