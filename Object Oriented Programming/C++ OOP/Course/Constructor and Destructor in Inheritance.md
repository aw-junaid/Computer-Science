### **Constructors and Destructors in Inheritance in C++**

In C++, **constructors** and **destructors** play an essential role in initializing and cleaning up objects when they are created and destroyed. When a class is involved in inheritance, constructors and destructors of both the **base class** and the **derived class** must be properly managed. Here's how constructors and destructors work in the context of inheritance.

---

### **1. Constructors in Inheritance**

In inheritance, **constructors** of the **base class** are automatically called before the constructor of the **derived class**. This ensures that the base class portion of an object is properly initialized before the derived class adds its own functionality.

#### **Constructor Call Order**
1. **Base class constructor** is called first.
2. **Derived class constructor** is called afterward.

#### **How Constructors Work**:
- If the base class has a constructor with arguments, the derived class must explicitly call it.
- If the base class has a default constructor, it will be called automatically unless the derived class specifies otherwise.

#### **Syntax for Constructor in Inheritance**:
- If the derived class has a constructor, you can initialize the base class constructor in the **initializer list** of the derived class constructor.

---

### **Example: Constructor in Inheritance**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() {
        cout << "Base class constructor" << endl;
    }

    Base(int val) {
        cout << "Base class constructor with value: " << val << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() : Base(10) {  // Calls Base(int) constructor
        cout << "Derived class constructor" << endl;
    }

    // Derived class constructor with no parameters
    Derived(int val) : Base(val) {  // Calls Base(int) constructor
        cout << "Derived class constructor with value: " << val << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating object d1" << endl;
    Derived d1;  // Calls Base(int) constructor, then Derived constructor

    cout << "\nCreating object d2" << endl;
    Derived d2(5);  // Calls Base(int) constructor, then Derived constructor

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Creating object d1
Base class constructor with value: 10
Derived class constructor

Creating object d2
Base class constructor with value: 5
Derived class constructor with value: 5
```

**Explanation**:
- In this example, the `Derived` class constructor calls the `Base(int)` constructor via the initializer list. This initializes the base class before the derived class's own constructor executes.
- The constructor of `Derived` calls the constructor of `Base` explicitly, passing an argument.

---

### **2. Destructors in Inheritance**

**Destructors** are responsible for cleaning up when an object is destroyed. In inheritance, the destructor of the **derived class** is called first, and then the destructor of the **base class** is called.

#### **Destructor Call Order**
1. **Derived class destructor** is called first.
2. **Base class destructor** is called afterward.

#### **Key Points About Destructors**:
- If the base class has a **virtual destructor**, it ensures that the correct destructor is called when an object is deleted through a pointer to the base class.
- If the base class destructor is not **virtual**, only the base class destructor is called when a derived class object is deleted via a base class pointer.

---

### **Example: Destructor in Inheritance**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() {
        cout << "Base class constructor" << endl;
    }

    ~Base() {  // Destructor
        cout << "Base class destructor" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() {
        cout << "Derived class constructor" << endl;
    }

    ~Derived() {  // Destructor
        cout << "Derived class destructor" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating object d1" << endl;
    Derived d1;  // Constructor will be called here
    // Destructor will be called when d1 goes out of scope

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Creating object d1
Base class constructor
Derived class constructor
Derived class destructor
Base class destructor
```

**Explanation**:
- When the `Derived` object `d1` goes out of scope, the **derived class destructor** is called first, followed by the **base class destructor**.
- This ensures that any resources or memory allocated in the derived class are cleaned up before cleaning up the base class.

---

### **3. Virtual Destructors and Inheritance**

In C++, if a base class destructor is **not virtual**, the derived class destructor might not be called when a derived class object is deleted via a pointer to the base class. This can lead to resource leaks.

To ensure that the derived class destructor is called when an object is deleted through a base class pointer, the base class destructor should be **virtual**.

#### **Example: Virtual Destructor in Inheritance**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() {
        cout << "Base class constructor" << endl;
    }

    virtual ~Base() {  // Virtual destructor
        cout << "Base class destructor" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() {
        cout << "Derived class constructor" << endl;
    }

    ~Derived() {  // Destructor
        cout << "Derived class destructor" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating object d1 using Base pointer" << endl;
    Base* b = new Derived();  // Create Derived object via Base pointer
    delete b;  // Will call both Derived and Base destructors

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Creating object d1 using Base pointer
Base class constructor
Derived class constructor
Derived class destructor
Base class destructor
```

**Explanation**:
- Since the base class destructor is **virtual**, when we delete a `Derived` class object through a pointer to the `Base` class (`delete b;`), the **derived class destructor** is called first, followed by the **base class destructor**.
- This ensures that resources allocated in both the derived and base classes are properly cleaned up.

### **Summary of Constructors and Destructors in Inheritance**

| **Aspect**                | **Details**                                                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Constructor Call Order** | Base class constructor is called first, followed by derived class. |
| **Destructor Call Order**  | Derived class destructor is called first, followed by base class. |
| **Virtual Destructors**    | Ensure correct destructor order when deleting via a base class pointer. |
| **Constructor Initialization** | Derived class constructors can initialize base class constructors via initializer lists. |
| **Access to Base Class**   | Base class constructors can be called explicitly or automatically (if no arguments). |

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. **Constructors**: The derived class constructor initializes the base class via the initializer list (if needed), and base class constructors are called before the derived class constructor.
2. **Destructors**: The derived class destructor is called first, followed by the base class destructor. To ensure proper cleanup when deleting an object via a base class pointer, the base class destructor should be **virtual**.
