**Scheduling Algorithms** are the methods that an operating system uses to decide the order in which processes or tasks are executed on the CPU. The goal of scheduling is to ensure efficient CPU utilization, fair distribution of resources, and responsiveness of the system. Scheduling algorithms can be broadly categorized into **non-preemptive** and **preemptive** based on whether a process can be interrupted once it starts executing.

### **1. Non-Preemptive Scheduling Algorithms**
Non-preemptive scheduling algorithms do not allow a running process to be interrupted. Once a process starts executing, it runs until it voluntarily gives up control (typically by requesting I/O or completing execution).

#### **a. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling**
   - **Description**: FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm. Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue, with no preemption.
   - **How it works**: The first process that arrives is the first to execute, following a FIFO (First In, First Out) rule.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Easy to implement.
     - Fair in terms of arrival order.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Convoy Effect**: Long processes can delay shorter ones, leading to high waiting times.
     - Poor **response time** for interactive systems.

#### **b. Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**
   - **Description**: Each process is assigned a priority. The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.
   - **How it works**: The process with the highest priority in the ready queue is selected next. Ties can be broken by additional criteria.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Useful in real-time or mission-critical systems where some tasks are more important.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Starvation** of low-priority processes.
     - The priority assignment can be tricky to manage.

#### **c. Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**
   - **Description**: SJF schedules processes based on their expected CPU burst time. The process with the shortest burst time is executed first.
   - **How it works**: The scheduler selects the process that will take the least time to execute next.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Minimizes **average waiting time** and **turnaround time**.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires knowledge of the burst time, which is not always available.
     - Leads to **starvation** of longer processes.

### **2. Preemptive Scheduling Algorithms**
Preemptive scheduling algorithms allow a process to be interrupted during its execution, so the CPU can be allocated to another process.

#### **a. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling**
   - **Description**: Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum). After its time slice is over, the process is placed back in the ready queue.
   - **How it works**: The CPU executes each process for a predefined quantum. If the process doesn't complete within that quantum, it is preempted and placed at the end of the ready queue.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Fair, as every process gets an equal share of the CPU.
     - Good for time-sharing systems.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - The choice of the time quantum is critical. Too small increases context switching overhead, while too large leads to poor responsiveness.
     - May cause high **waiting time** for processes with short burst times.

#### **b. Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)**
   - **Description**: In preemptive priority scheduling, a process with a higher priority can preempt a running process with a lower priority.
   - **How it works**: The scheduler selects the process with the highest priority. If a new process with a higher priority arrives, it preempts the running process.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Useful for real-time systems where higher-priority processes need to be executed first.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Starvation** of low-priority processes.
     - Difficult to manage priority values effectively.

#### **c. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling**
   - **Description**: SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF. The process with the shortest remaining burst time is executed next.
   - **How it works**: If a new process with a shorter burst time arrives, it preempts the currently running process, which is re-added to the ready queue with its remaining burst time.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Minimizes **average waiting time** and **turnaround time**.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires knowledge of the remaining burst time, which is difficult to estimate accurately.
     - Can lead to **starvation** of long processes.

### **3. Advanced Scheduling Algorithms**

#### **a. Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
   - **Description**: Multilevel queue scheduling divides processes into different queues based on characteristics such as priority, I/O vs. CPU-bound, or user vs. system processes. Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.
   - **How it works**: Processes are assigned to different queues, and each queue is scheduled according to its own rules (e.g., Round Robin for interactive processes, FCFS for batch processes).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Provides a more nuanced approach to process scheduling based on different process types.
     - Useful for systems with varied workloads.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Complex to implement and manage.
     - May result in inefficient scheduling if queues are not well designed.

#### **b. Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**
   - **Description**: This is a more flexible version of multilevel queue scheduling. Processes are allowed to move between queues based on their behavior (e.g., if a CPU-bound process starts using less CPU, it can be moved to a higher-priority queue).
   - **How it works**: Processes are initially placed in higher-priority queues and may be moved to lower-priority queues if they exhibit CPU-bound behavior (i.e., if they use the CPU for longer periods without I/O).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Provides better flexibility and responsiveness.
     - Can be fine-tuned for real-time systems, balancing CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Complex to implement and fine-tune.
     - Requires monitoring of process behavior, which can lead to additional overhead.

#### **c. Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling (Real-Time)**
   - **Description**: EDF is a real-time scheduling algorithm where the process with the earliest deadline is given the highest priority.
   - **How it works**: Each process is assigned a deadline. The scheduler selects the process with the earliest deadline to run next.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Optimal for systems where meeting deadlines is critical (real-time systems).
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Can be difficult to implement in non-real-time systems.
     - Scheduling overhead can be high due to frequent context switching.

#### **d. Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) (Real-Time)**
   - **Description**: Rate Monotonic Scheduling is a fixed-priority algorithm used in real-time systems. The process with the shortest period (i.e., the one that needs to run more frequently) is given the highest priority.
   - **How it works**: Tasks are assigned priorities based on their periods. The task with the shortest period is given the highest priority, and so on.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple to implement.
     - Suitable for periodic tasks in real-time systems.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Not always optimal if tasks have arbitrary deadlines.
     - Tasks must have fixed periods to be effective.

#### **e. Lottery Scheduling**
   - **Description**: Lottery scheduling is a probabilistic scheduling algorithm where each process is given lottery tickets, and the process with the winning ticket is selected to run.
   - **How it works**: Each process receives a number of tickets proportional to its priority. A random ticket is drawn, and the corresponding process is given the CPU.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Fair and flexible, easy to implement.
     - Can be used in systems with variable workloads.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - May not guarantee meeting deadlines in real-time systems.
     - Can lead to high variance in execution time.

### **Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: The operating system can forcibly stop a running process to assign the CPU to another process. Examples include **Round Robin**, **Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)**, and **SRTF**.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Ensures fairness and responsiveness.
     - Suitable for time-sharing and interactive systems.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - High overhead due to frequent context switches.
  
- **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**: Once a process starts executing, it runs to completion or until it voluntarily gives up the CPU. Examples include **FCFS**, **Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**, and **SJF (Non-Preemptive)**.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Lower overhead from fewer context switches.
     - More predictable process behavior.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Poor responsiveness for interactive tasks.
     - Can lead to **starvation** in some cases.

### **Summary**

Scheduling algorithms play a critical role in managing the CPU’s time and ensuring that processes are executed efficiently. The choice of algorithm depends on the system’s requirements, such as whether it’s a real-time system, an interactive system, or a general-purpose system. Common scheduling algorithms include **FCFS**, **Round Robin**, **SJF**, **Priority Scheduling**, **EDF**, **RMS**, and **Lottery Scheduling**, each with its strengths and trade-offs.
