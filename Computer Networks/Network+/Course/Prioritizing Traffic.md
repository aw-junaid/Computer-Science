### **Prioritizing Traffic**

Prioritizing traffic on a network is essential to ensure that critical applications or services receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency, even when the network is congested. This is particularly important for real-time applications such as VoIP, video conferencing, and online gaming, which require higher priority to function smoothly.

Traffic prioritization is typically achieved through mechanisms like **Quality of Service (QoS)**, **Differentiated Services (DiffServ)**, and **Class of Service (CoS)**.

### **1. Quality of Service (QoS)**

QoS refers to the techniques used to manage network resources by prioritizing certain types of traffic, guaranteeing specific levels of performance for important applications, and preventing congestion. QoS is implemented at different layers of the OSI model, particularly in Layer 2 (Data Link) and Layer 3 (Network).

#### **QoS Parameters**

QoS allows network administrators to control the following parameters:

1. **Bandwidth**: The amount of data that can be transmitted in a given time period. QoS can allocate a certain portion of bandwidth to critical traffic.
   
2. **Latency**: The time it takes for data to travel from source to destination. Real-time applications like VoIP require low latency.

3. **Jitter**: The variation in packet arrival times. High jitter can disrupt streaming applications. QoS mechanisms attempt to reduce jitter for time-sensitive traffic.

4. **Packet Loss**: The loss of data packets during transmission. Prioritizing traffic can prevent packet loss for critical applications.

#### **Traffic Classification and Marking**

The first step in QoS is to classify and mark traffic, often based on attributes such as IP address, port number, protocol type, etc. Traffic can be classified into categories such as high, medium, or low priority.

1. **Traffic Classification**: Identifying which types of traffic should receive priority. For example, VoIP traffic can be classified as high priority.
   
2. **Traffic Marking**: Marking packets with specific values to indicate their priority. This is done using mechanisms like:
   - **IP Precedence** (IP header): A 3-bit field used to mark the priority of the packet.
   - **Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)** (Layer 3): A 6-bit field in the IP header that marks packets for different traffic classes.
   - **802.1p** (Layer 2): A priority code point (PCP) that marks packets in the Layer 2 header, especially in Ethernet frames.

### **2. Differentiated Services (DiffServ)**

DiffServ is a scalable and straightforward method for implementing QoS. It uses the DSCP field in the IP header to mark packets for different priority levels.

#### **DiffServ Architecture**

- **Per-Hop Behavior (PHB)**: Defines how packets should be treated at each network hop. Common PHBs include:
  - **EF (Expedited Forwarding)**: Used for low-latency, high-priority traffic (e.g., VoIP).
  - **AF (Assured Forwarding)**: Used for traffic that can be delayed but not dropped, with varying levels of priority (e.g., email or file transfers).
  - **BE (Best Effort)**: Default class for regular traffic with no prioritization.

- **Marking and Policing**: DiffServ allows packets to be marked at the source and policed in the network. Policing ensures that packets adhere to the agreed-upon traffic profile (e.g., rate limits).

#### **DiffServ Code Points (DSCP)**

- DSCP values are used to define the level of service required for the traffic. Common DSCP values include:
  - **EF (Expedited Forwarding)**: DSCP 46, used for real-time traffic (e.g., VoIP).
  - **CS0 (Default)**: DSCP 0, used for best-effort traffic.
  - **CS6 (Network Control)**: DSCP 48, used for network control traffic (e.g., routing protocols).

### **3. Class of Service (CoS)**

CoS is a Layer 2 mechanism that operates on Ethernet frames to prioritize traffic. It uses the **802.1Q VLAN tag** to assign a priority to each frame. This is especially useful in **LAN** environments and when traffic is transmitted over virtual LANs (VLANs).

#### **802.1p Priority Levels**

In 802.1Q tagging, a **3-bit field** (called the **Priority Code Point** or **PCP**) is used to mark the frame with one of the following priority levels:

- **0 (Lowest priority)** to **7 (Highest priority)**

A CoS value is included in the VLAN tag in an Ethernet frame. For example, if VoIP traffic needs to be prioritized, it could be marked with a PCP value of **5** for high priority.

### **4. Configuring QoS on Cisco Devices**

To configure QoS on Cisco devices, you need to define the policy, classify the traffic, and apply the policy to the relevant interfaces. Here's an example of how to configure QoS:

#### **Step 1: Define QoS Policy**

1. **Create a Class Map** to identify traffic types:
   ```bash
   Router(config)# class-map match-any VOICE
   Router(config-cmap)# match protocol rtp
   ```

2. **Create a Policy Map** to define actions for each class:
   ```bash
   Router(config)# policy-map PRIORITY_POLICY
   Router(config-pmap)# class VOICE
   Router(config-pmap-c)# priority 512
   Router(config-pmap-c)# class class-default
   Router(config-pmap-c)# fair-queue
   ```

#### **Step 2: Apply the Policy Map**

1. Apply the policy to the interface that will handle the traffic:
   ```bash
   Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   Router(config-if)# service-policy output PRIORITY_POLICY
   ```

### **5. Traffic Shaping and Policing**

- **Traffic Shaping**: Traffic shaping controls the rate at which traffic is sent out of a device. It smooths traffic bursts by delaying excess packets.
  - **Use Case**: Limiting bandwidth usage for non-critical applications.
  - **Configuration**: 
    ```bash
    Router(config)# policy-map SHAPE_POLICY
    Router(config-pmap)# class class-default
    Router(config-pmap-c)# shape average 512000
    ```

- **Traffic Policing**: Policing ensures that traffic does not exceed certain thresholds. If it does, excess traffic is either dropped or remarked with a lower priority.
  - **Use Case**: Enforcing bandwidth limits for less important traffic.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```bash
    Router(config)# policy-map POLICE_POLICY
    Router(config-pmap)# class class-default
    Router(config-pmap-c)# police 1000000 80000 80000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop
    ```

### **6. Prioritizing Traffic with MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**

MPLS is another method for prioritizing traffic in large-scale networks. It allows traffic to be classified and forwarded based on labels, improving network performance and ensuring that high-priority traffic is treated with more urgency.

- **Traffic Engineering**: MPLS provides a mechanism for steering traffic along specific paths in the network, ensuring that high-priority traffic avoids congestion.

- **Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)**: LDP is used to establish and distribute labels for traffic forwarding in MPLS networks.

---

### **Conclusion**

Prioritizing traffic is vital for managing network performance and ensuring that critical applications receive the necessary resources. Through QoS, DiffServ, and CoS, networks can guarantee that voice, video, and other latency-sensitive applications are delivered efficiently, even in congested conditions. Proper configuration of these mechanisms can result in smoother, more reliable network performance, particularly for businesses relying on real-time communication tools.
