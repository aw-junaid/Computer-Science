In Apache Derby, the `DELETE` statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table. You can delete specific rows by using a `WHERE` clause to specify the conditions, or you can delete all rows in the table by omitting the `WHERE` clause. 

### Basic Syntax for `DELETE`
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];
```
- **`table_name`**: The name of the table from which to delete data.
- **`WHERE`**: (Optional) A condition to specify which rows to delete. If omitted, all rows in the table are deleted.

### Example 1: Deleting a Single Row
To delete a specific row based on a condition (e.g., deleting an employee with a specific `id`):

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id = 1;
```
- This deletes the row where the `id` is `1` from the `employees` table.

### Example 2: Deleting Multiple Rows
You can delete multiple rows by specifying a condition that matches more than one row.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 3;
```
- This deletes all rows from the `employees` table where the `department_id` is `3`.

### Example 3: Deleting All Rows from a Table
If you want to delete all rows in a table, you can omit the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees;
```
- This will remove all rows from the `employees` table, but the table structure remains intact.

### Example 4: Deleting Rows Based on a Range
You can delete rows based on a range of values using operators like `BETWEEN`.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```
- This deletes all rows where the `hire_date` is between `'2024-01-01'` and `'2024-12-31'`.

### Example 5: Deleting Rows Using `IN` 
You can use the `IN` operator to delete rows based on a list of values.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id IN (2, 4, 6);
```
- This deletes the rows where the `id` is either `2`, `4`, or `6`.

### Example 6: Deleting Rows Using `LIKE`
The `LIKE` operator can be used to delete rows where a column matches a pattern.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
```
- This deletes all employees whose `name` starts with the letter "J".

### Example 7: Deleting Rows with `IS NULL`
You can delete rows where a column contains a `NULL` value.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE phone_number IS NULL;
```
- This deletes all rows where the `phone_number` column is `NULL`.

### Example 8: Deleting Data Using Subqueries
You can use a subquery to specify the rows to delete.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```
- This deletes all employees who belong to the department with the name "Sales".

### Example 9: Cascading Deletes (Foreign Key Constraints)
If a row in a parent table is deleted, and there are foreign key constraints that reference it from a child table, Apache Derby will enforce the deletion of dependent rows in the child table, depending on how the foreign key is defined (with `ON DELETE CASCADE`).

For example, consider the following tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Now, if you delete a department, all employees in that department will also be deleted due to the `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraint.

```sql
DELETE FROM departments
WHERE department_name = 'Sales';
```
- This will delete the "Sales" department and all employees associated with it, because of the cascading delete defined on the foreign key.

### Important Considerations:
1. **Data Loss**: The `DELETE` statement is a **destructive operation**. Once data is deleted, it is not recoverable unless you have a backup.

2. **Using `WHERE` Clause**: Always use a `WHERE` clause unless you intend to delete all rows. Omitting the `WHERE` clause will delete every row in the table.

3. **Cascading Deletes**: If you have foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, deleting a row in a parent table will automatically delete rows in the child table that reference it. Make sure to check foreign key relationships before performing delete operations.

4. **Permissions**: Only users with the appropriate privileges can delete rows. Typically, the table owner or a user with delete permissions can execute this statement.

5. **Performance**: Deleting large numbers of rows can be resource-intensive and slow, particularly if there are indexes or foreign key constraints involved. You may want to delete rows in batches if you are dealing with a large table.

### Conclusion
The `DELETE` statement in Apache Derby provides a powerful way to remove data from tables. Whether you're deleting specific rows, all rows, or rows based on complex conditions, you can perform the deletion efficiently using the `WHERE` clause. Be mindful of cascading effects when foreign key constraints are involved, and always use the `WHERE` clause to avoid unintentional deletion of all rows.
