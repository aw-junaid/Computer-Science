### **Protocol Data Units (PDUs)**  

Protocol Data Units (PDUs) are units of data exchanged between entities in a specific layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) or TCP/IP models. Each layer encapsulates data from the layer above it with its own specific PDU format to ensure proper communication and functionality.

### **PDU Types and Their Layers**  

The PDU changes as it moves through the OSI or TCP/IP model layers. Here's how PDUs are defined across layers:  

| **OSI Layer**           | **PDU Name**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application Layer**    | **Data**             | Raw information to be transmitted, created by the application.                  |
| **Presentation Layer**   | **Data**             | Same as above; handles translation and encryption but keeps data as is.         |
| **Session Layer**        | **Data**             | Same as above; manages connections and session establishment.                   |
| **Transport Layer**      | **Segment** (TCP) / **Datagram** (UDP) | Adds transport-specific headers, including ports and sequence numbers.          |
| **Network Layer**        | **Packet**           | Encapsulates transport data with IP addressing information.                     |
| **Data Link Layer**      | **Frame**            | Adds MAC addressing and error-checking information to form a frame.             |
| **Physical Layer**       | **Bits**             | Converts frames into binary signals for transmission over the medium.           |

### **Encapsulation Process**  

As data moves down the layers of the OSI model, it is encapsulated with headers (and sometimes trailers) specific to each layer:  

1. **Application Layer**: Data is created and prepared for transmission.  
2. **Transport Layer**: Adds transport-specific headers (e.g., TCP or UDP headers).  
3. **Network Layer**: Adds IP headers with source and destination IP addresses.  
4. **Data Link Layer**: Adds MAC headers and trailers to form frames.  
5. **Physical Layer**: Converts the frame into electrical, optical, or radio signals.  

When data is received, the process is reversed (decapsulation), with each layer stripping off its respective header and processing the information.

### **Examples of PDUs in Action**  

1. **Web Browsing (HTTP)**:  
   - **Application Layer**: Sends an HTTP request (`Data`).  
   - **Transport Layer**: TCP adds a segment header (`Segment`).  
   - **Network Layer**: IP addresses are added (`Packet`).  
   - **Data Link Layer**: MAC addresses and frame information are added (`Frame`).  
   - **Physical Layer**: Transmitted as binary signals (`Bits`).  

2. **Video Streaming (UDP)**:  
   - Similar process, but the transport layer PDU is called a **datagram** instead of a **segment**, reflecting the connectionless nature of UDP.

### **PDU and Network Troubleshooting**  

1. **Data Analysis**: Tools like Wireshark capture PDUs at various layers to analyze traffic and identify issues.  
2. **Layer-Specific Problems**:  
   - **Physical Layer (Bits)**: Check cables, signals, or wireless connections.  
   - **Data Link Layer (Frames)**: Look for frame errors or MAC address issues.  
   - **Network Layer (Packets)**: Verify IP configurations and routing issues.  
   - **Transport Layer (Segments/Datagrams)**: Analyze ports, sequence numbers, and retransmissions.
