**Postman** is a popular collaboration platform for API development that is widely used by developers to design, test, document, and monitor APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a user-friendly interface and a set of powerful tools that streamline the process of interacting with APIs.

### Key Features of Postman:
1. **API Requests**: You can create and send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to APIs. It supports REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and WebSocket APIs.
   
2. **Collections**: Postman allows you to organize requests into collections, making it easier to manage and share APIs.

3. **Environment Variables**: It enables you to create environments (e.g., development, testing, production) and use variables that change based on the environment.

4. **Testing and Automation**: Postman includes a built-in testing framework where you can write scripts to automate tests and validate API responses. It supports testing with JavaScript.

5. **Documentation**: You can generate dynamic API documentation based on your collections, which can be shared with team members or external users.

6. **Mock Servers**: Postman can create mock servers to simulate API responses, which is useful when an API is still under development.

7. **Monitoring**: Postman allows you to set up monitors that automatically run collections at scheduled intervals, ensuring your APIs are performing as expected.

8. **Collaboration**: Teams can collaborate on API projects using Postmanâ€™s cloud-based workspace, making it easy to share collections, environments, and documentation.

9. **API Version Control**: You can manage different versions of your APIs and track changes over time, ensuring backward compatibility.

### Common Use Cases:
- **API Testing**: Postman is widely used to test APIs by sending requests and analyzing responses.
- **API Development**: Developers use Postman to design and prototype APIs before integrating them into applications.
- **Automated Testing**: Postman scripts can be used to automate tests for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **API Documentation**: Postman helps in generating and maintaining API documentation.

Postman is available as a free app, but it also offers premium features for teams, such as collaboration tools, advanced monitoring, and enhanced security.

### Getting Started:
1. Download and install Postman from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2. Open Postman and create a new request or collection.
3. Set the HTTP method, URL, and headers, and then send the request to interact with the API.
   
Postman is widely regarded for its simplicity and powerful features, making it an essential tool for developers working with APIs.
