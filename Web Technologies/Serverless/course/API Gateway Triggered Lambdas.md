**API Gateway-triggered Lambdas** are a common use case in serverless applications. With this setup, you can expose HTTP endpoints (RESTful APIs or HTTP APIs) that trigger AWS Lambda functions when invoked by client requests. This allows you to build fully serverless web applications, microservices, or APIs with minimal infrastructure management.

In the **Serverless Framework**, API Gateway can be easily integrated with Lambda functions to create scalable, cost-effective APIs. Here’s how to set up an API Gateway-triggered Lambda.

### Key Concepts

1. **API Gateway**: An AWS service that enables you to create, publish, and manage APIs. It can route HTTP requests to backend Lambda functions or other services.
   
2. **Lambda Function**: The serverless function that is executed when the API endpoint is triggered.

3. **HTTP Methods**: API Gateway supports various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. You can configure these methods in your `serverless.yml` to trigger specific Lambda functions.

4. **Event Sources**: API Gateway acts as an event source for Lambda. When a client sends an HTTP request to an API Gateway endpoint, the corresponding Lambda function is invoked.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up API Gateway Triggered Lambdas

### 1. **Create a New Serverless Service**

If you haven’t already, you can create a new Serverless service using the Serverless Framework.

```bash
serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path api-gateway-service
cd api-gateway-service
```

This creates a new Serverless project with a `serverless.yml` configuration file and a `handler.js` file where your Lambda functions will be defined.

### 2. **Edit `serverless.yml` for API Gateway Integration**

In the `serverless.yml` file, you define the Lambda functions, events (API Gateway triggers), and other configurations such as memory size, region, etc.

```yaml
service: api-gateway-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x  # Choose the appropriate runtime
  region: us-east-1

functions:
  getUser:
    handler: handler.getUser
    events:
      - http:
          path: user/{id}  # API path with dynamic parameter
          method: get  # HTTP GET method
          cors: true  # Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for client-side access

  createUser:
    handler: handler.createUser
    events:
      - http:
          path: user  # API path for creating user
          method: post  # HTTP POST method
          cors: true

  updateUser:
    handler: handler.updateUser
    events:
      - http:
          path: user/{id}  # API path with dynamic parameter
          method: put  # HTTP PUT method
          cors: true

  deleteUser:
    handler: handler.deleteUser
    events:
      - http:
          path: user/{id}  # API path with dynamic parameter
          method: delete  # HTTP DELETE method
          cors: true

resources:
  Resources:
    # You can add more resources like DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, etc. if needed
```

### Explanation:

- **Functions**: Each function corresponds to a Lambda function that gets triggered by an HTTP request to a specific endpoint.
  - `getUser`: This Lambda is triggered by a `GET` request to `/user/{id}`, where `{id}` is a dynamic path parameter (e.g., `/user/123`).
  - `createUser`: This Lambda is triggered by a `POST` request to `/user`, which is used to create a new user.
  - `updateUser`: This Lambda is triggered by a `PUT` request to `/user/{id}`, used to update a user’s information.
  - `deleteUser`: This Lambda is triggered by a `DELETE` request to `/user/{id}`, used to delete a user.
  
- **Events**: The `events` section under each function specifies that the function will be triggered by an API Gateway HTTP event.
  - `path`: Defines the path to which the API Gateway should route requests.
  - `method`: Defines the HTTP method that triggers the Lambda function (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
  - `cors`: Enable or disable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which is important if you’re calling the API from a client-side application (e.g., a web browser).

### 3. **Write Lambda Functions in `handler.js`**

The `handler.js` file is where you define the actual Lambda function logic. Here's an example implementation for the functions defined in the `serverless.yml`.

```javascript
module.exports.getUser = async (event) => {
  const userId = event.pathParameters.id;
  // Fetch user from the database (e.g., DynamoDB)
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: `User with ID ${userId}` }),
  };
};

module.exports.createUser = async (event) => {
  const user = JSON.parse(event.body);  // Parse the JSON payload from the request body
  // Logic to create a user (e.g., store in DynamoDB)
  return {
    statusCode: 201,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'User created successfully', user }),
  };
};

module.exports.updateUser = async (event) => {
  const userId = event.pathParameters.id;
  const userData = JSON.parse(event.body);  // Parse the updated data from the request body
  // Logic to update user data in the database
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: `User with ID ${userId} updated`, userData }),
  };
};

module.exports.deleteUser = async (event) => {
  const userId = event.pathParameters.id;
  // Logic to delete user from the database
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: `User with ID ${userId} deleted` }),
  };
};
```

### 4. **Deploy the Service**

Once you’ve configured your `serverless.yml` and written the Lambda functions in `handler.js`, you can deploy the service to AWS using the Serverless Framework:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

This command does the following:
- Packages your Lambda functions.
- Creates the necessary API Gateway configuration.
- Deploys the Lambda functions to AWS.
- Sets up the routes and endpoints in API Gateway.

After the deployment is complete, you’ll see output that contains the URL of the deployed API.

Example output:
```
Service Information
service: api-gateway-service
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
apiUrl: https://xyz123abc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
```

### 5. **Test the API Endpoints**

After the deployment, you can test your API by sending HTTP requests to the API Gateway endpoints.

For example, to create a new user, you can send a POST request to `/user`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://xyz123abc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/user \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}'
```

For a `GET` request to retrieve a user by ID:

```bash
curl https://xyz123abc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/user/123
```

### 6. **Enable CORS for Front-End Applications**

If you're building a front-end application that interacts with this API (e.g., a web app), you'll need to ensure that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled so the browser can send requests to your API. This can be easily done in the `serverless.yml` configuration by adding `cors: true` under each `http` event, as shown in the previous example.

### Conclusion

With the Serverless Framework, it’s easy to set up **API Gateway-triggered Lambdas** to handle HTTP requests. You define your endpoints and HTTP methods in the `serverless.yml` file, then implement your Lambda functions in `handler.js`. This setup enables you to build RESTful APIs, microservices, or web apps without managing infrastructure.

The **Serverless Framework** automatically handles the deployment of both the Lambda functions and API Gateway configuration, allowing you to focus on writing the logic for your endpoints.
