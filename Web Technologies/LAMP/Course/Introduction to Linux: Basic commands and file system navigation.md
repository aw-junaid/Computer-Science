### **Introduction to Linux: Basic Commands and File System Navigation**

Linux is a powerful and flexible operating system widely used for development, servers, and general-purpose computing. It operates through the **command-line interface (CLI)**, which gives users control over the system by entering text-based commands.

Here's an introduction to **basic Linux commands** and **file system navigation**:

### **1. Basic Linux Commands**

#### **Navigating the System**
- **`pwd`** (Print Working Directory): Displays the current directory you're in.
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

- **`cd`** (Change Directory): Changes the current directory.
   - Move to a specific directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/directory
     ```
   - Move to the home directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~
     ```
   - Move up one directory level:
     ```bash
     cd ..
     ```
   - Move to the previous directory:
     ```bash
     cd -
     ```

- **`ls`** (List): Lists files and directories in the current directory.
   - Basic listing:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```
   - List with detailed information (permissions, size, etc.):
     ```bash
     ls -l
     ```
   - List all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot):
     ```bash
     ls -a
     ```

#### **File and Directory Operations**
- **`touch`**: Creates a new empty file.
   ```bash
   touch filename.txt
   ```

- **`mkdir`**: Creates a new directory.
   ```bash
   mkdir directory_name
   ```

- **`cp`** (Copy): Copies files or directories.
   - Copy a file:
     ```bash
     cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt
     ```
   - Copy a directory (use `-r` for recursive copying):
     ```bash
     cp -r source_directory destination_directory
     ```

- **`mv`** (Move/Rename): Moves or renames files and directories.
   - Move a file:
     ```bash
     mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
     ```
   - Rename a file:
     ```bash
     mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
     ```

- **`rm`** (Remove): Deletes files or directories.
   - Remove a file:
     ```bash
     rm file.txt
     ```
   - Remove a directory (use `-r` to remove directories recursively):
     ```bash
     rm -r directory_name
     ```

- **`cat`**: Displays the content of a file.
   ```bash
   cat file.txt
   ```

- **`nano`** or **`vim`**: Opens a file for editing in the terminal (text editors).
   - Open a file in **nano**:
     ```bash
     nano file.txt
     ```

- **`echo`**: Prints text to the terminal or to a file.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, world!"   # prints to terminal
   echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt  # writes to a file
   ```

#### **Permissions and Ownership**
- **`chmod`** (Change Mode): Changes file permissions.
   - Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the owner:
     ```bash
     chmod u+rwx file.txt
     ```
   - Grant read, write, and execute permissions to everyone:
     ```bash
     chmod a+rwx file.txt
     ```

- **`chown`** (Change Ownership): Changes the owner or group of a file or directory.
   ```bash
   chown user:group file.txt
   ```

#### **Viewing File Content**
- **`cat`**: Displays the content of a file.
   ```bash
   cat file.txt
   ```

- **`less`**: Opens a file for viewing, allowing scrolling and searching.
   ```bash
   less file.txt
   ```

- **`head`**: Displays the first few lines of a file.
   ```bash
   head file.txt
   ```

- **`tail`**: Displays the last few lines of a file.
   ```bash
   tail file.txt
   ```

- **`grep`**: Searches for a string in a file.
   ```bash
   grep "search_string" file.txt
   ```

### **2. Understanding the Linux File System**

Linux organizes files in a hierarchical directory structure, beginning from the root directory (`/`). Here’s a quick overview of important directories in the Linux file system:

- **`/`** (Root Directory): The top-most directory in the file system. All other directories are subdirectories of `/`.
- **`/home/`**: Contains the home directories for all users on the system. For example, `/home/user1/`.
- **`/bin/`**: Contains essential system binaries (commands) like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and `cat`.
- **`/etc/`**: Contains system configuration files (e.g., `passwd` for user management).
- **`/var/`**: Contains variable data like logs, caches, and databases.
- **`/tmp/`**: Temporary files used by applications. Files here are usually deleted on reboot.
- **`/usr/`**: Contains user-installed applications and libraries.
- **`/lib/`**: Contains shared libraries necessary for system programs.
- **`/dev/`**: Contains device files, which represent hardware devices (like hard drives, USB devices, etc.).
- **`/proc/`**: A virtual directory that provides information about the system and running processes.

### **3. File System Navigation**

- **`/` (Root directory)**: The starting point of the file system. All directories and files are branches under the root.
  ```bash
  cd /
  ```

- **Home Directory (`~`)**: Every user has a home directory (e.g., `/home/username`). The `~` symbol refers to the current user’s home directory.
  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

- **Relative and Absolute Paths**:
  - **Absolute path**: The full path to a file or directory, starting from the root (`/`).
    ```bash
    cd /home/user1/Documents
    ```
  - **Relative path**: A path relative to the current directory.
    ```bash
    cd Documents
    ```

- **Using `.` and `..`**:
  - **`.` (current directory)**: Refers to the current directory.
    ```bash
    ls .
    ```
  - **`..` (parent directory)**: Refers to the parent directory (one level up).
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

### **4. Managing Processes and System Resources**

- **`top`**: Displays real-time information about system processes and resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.).
   ```bash
   top
   ```

- **`ps`** (Process Status): Lists currently running processes.
   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```

- **`kill`**: Terminates a running process by its Process ID (PID).
   ```bash
   kill PID
   ```

- **`df`**: Displays disk space usage of mounted file systems.
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

- **`free`**: Displays memory usage.
   ```bash
   free -h
   ```

---

### **5. Basic Networking Commands**

- **`ping`**: Tests connectivity to a remote host or server.
   ```bash
   ping google.com
   ```

- **`ifconfig`** or **`ip a`**: Displays network interface information.
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```

- **`ssh`** (Secure Shell): Connects to a remote server securely over SSH.
   ```bash
   ssh username@remote_host
   ```

---

### **6. Helpful Tips**
- **Tab completion**: Press `Tab` to autocomplete commands or file names.
- **Clear the terminal**: Use the `clear` command to clear the terminal screen.
- **Man pages**: Use the `man` command to access the manual (documentation) for any command.
   ```bash
   man ls
   ```
