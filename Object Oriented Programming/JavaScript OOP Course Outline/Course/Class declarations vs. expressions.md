### **Class Declarations vs. Class Expressions in JavaScript**

In JavaScript, **class declarations** and **class expressions** are two different ways of defining classes. They share many similarities but also have some key differences. Let’s compare them in detail:

---

### **1. Class Declarations**

A **class declaration** is the most common and straightforward way to define a class. It uses the `class` keyword followed by the class name.

#### **Syntax**
```javascript
class ClassName {
  constructor(parameters) {
    // Initialization code
  }

  // Methods
  method1() {
    // Code
  }
}
```

#### **Example: Class Declaration**
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
person1.greet(); // Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

#### **Key Points:**
- **Hoisting:** Class declarations are **hoisted** in the same way as function declarations, but they are not accessible until the class is defined. This means you cannot use the class before its declaration in the code.
  - **Example of hoisting issue:**
    ```javascript
    const person = new Person('Alice', 25); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Person' before initialization.
    
    class Person {
      constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
    }
    ```
- **Name:** The class has a name that can be referenced in the code.
- **Instantiation:** You can create instances of the class using `new ClassName()`.

---

### **2. Class Expressions**

A **class expression** allows you to define a class as part of an expression, and it can be assigned to a variable. It can also be anonymous (without a name).

#### **Syntax**
```javascript
const ClassName = class {
  constructor(parameters) {
    // Initialization code
  }

  // Methods
  method1() {
    // Code
  }
};
```

#### **Example: Class Expression**
```javascript
const Person = class {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
};

const person1 = new Person('Bob', 35);
person1.greet(); // Hello, my name is Bob and I am 35 years old.
```

#### **Key Points:**
- **Hoisting:** Class expressions are **not hoisted**. This means you need to define the class before you can instantiate it. You cannot use a class defined as part of an expression before it’s assigned to the variable.
  - **Example of hoisting issue:**
    ```javascript
    const person = new Person('Bob', 35); // TypeError: Person is not a constructor
    
    const Person = class {
      constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
    };
    ```
- **Name (Anonymous Class Expression):** You can create a **named** or **anonymous** class expression.
  - **Anonymous Class Expression:**
    ```javascript
    const person = new class {
      constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
    }('Alice', 28);
    console.log(person.name); // Alice
    ```
  - **Named Class Expression:** 
    ```javascript
    const Person = class Person {
      constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
    };
    ```

- **Assigning to a Variable:** The class is assigned to a variable, which can be used to instantiate new objects.

### **Key Differences Between Class Declarations and Class Expressions**

| Feature                        | **Class Declarations**                        | **Class Expressions**                        |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition Style**            | Defined using the `class` keyword directly.   | Defined as part of an expression and assigned to a variable. |
| **Hoisting**                    | Hoisted (but cannot be used before declaration). | Not hoisted (must be defined before use).  |
| **Naming**                      | Always named.                                | Can be named or anonymous.                 |
| **Usage**                       | Commonly used for defining classes.          | Often used when defining classes dynamically or as part of an expression. |
| **Instantiation**               | Instantiated with `new ClassName()`.         | Instantiated with `new variableName()`.    |

### **Comparison Example:**

#### **Class Declaration Example**
```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Animal('Dog');
dog.speak(); // Dog makes a sound.
```

#### **Class Expression Example**
```javascript
const Animal = class {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
};

const dog = new Animal('Dog');
dog.speak(); // Dog makes a sound.
```

#### **Anonymous Class Expression**
```javascript
const animal = new class {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}('Dog');

animal.speak(); // Dog makes a sound.
```

### **When to Use Each**
- **Class Declarations**: Use class declarations when you need a named class and when you want to ensure the class is hoisted and available throughout your code.
- **Class Expressions**: Use class expressions when you need to define a class dynamically or anonymously, or when you want to assign a class to a variable (e.g., in a function, callback, or module).
