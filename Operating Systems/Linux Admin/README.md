CentOS (Community ENTerprise Operating System) is a free and open-source Linux distribution that is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It was designed to be a binary-compatible, community-supported version of RHEL, providing a stable and enterprise-ready platform without the cost of RHEL's commercial support.
