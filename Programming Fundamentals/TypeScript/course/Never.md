### TypeScript - `never` Type

In TypeScript, the `never` type represents values that will **never occur**. It is used in situations where a function or variable cannot return a value, or where a value can never be assigned to it. The `never` type is quite different from `void` in TypeScript, which represents functions that return no value. A `never` type, on the other hand, indicates that something cannot finish successfully or that it will never return (e.g., through throwing an error or entering an infinite loop).

### 1. **When to Use `never` Type**

You use the `never` type in the following scenarios:
- A function that throws an exception and does not return.
- A function that enters an infinite loop (so it never returns).
- A variable that will never hold a value because the flow of execution is guaranteed to never allow a value.

It is a special type because it signals that **execution does not continue** and therefore no value can be returned or assigned to a variable of type `never`.

---

### 2. **Function That Throws an Error**

A common case where `never` is used is with functions that throw exceptions. Since the function does not return a value, TypeScript infers that the return type must be `never`.

#### Example: Function That Throws an Error

```typescript
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

let result = throwError("Something went wrong");
// The function never returns a value, so `result` will never hold any value.
```

- The `throwError` function has a return type of `never`, because it always throws an exception and does not return any value.
- If you try to assign the result of `throwError` to a variable, TypeScript will ensure that no value is ever returned.

---

### 3. **Function with Infinite Loop**

If a function contains an infinite loop, it will also never return. This is another case where the `never` type is appropriate.

#### Example: Function with an Infinite Loop

```typescript
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {
    console.log("Running forever...");
  }
}

infiniteLoop();  // This function will never finish, so its return type is `never`
```

- In this case, the function `infiniteLoop` will never return or complete execution, so its return type is `never`.

---

### 4. **Exhaustiveness Checking with `never`**

`never` can be useful in **exhaustiveness checks** when working with **switch** statements or when dealing with discriminated unions. The idea is that the `never` type helps TypeScript ensure that all possible cases are handled, and any missing cases in the logic would result in a type error.

#### Example: Exhaustiveness Checking in a Switch Statement

```typescript
type Shape = 
  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }
  | { kind: "square"; side: number };

function area(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius * shape.radius;
    case "square":
      return shape.side * shape.side;
    default:
      // If we reach this point, TypeScript knows that all cases have been handled.
      // The `never` type ensures that we can't accidentally forget a case.
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
```

- In the `area` function, the `default` case is never expected to occur if all possible `Shape` types are accounted for. The `_exhaustiveCheck` variable is assigned a value of type `never`.
- TypeScript will throw an error if we add a new type to the `Shape` union without updating the switch statement, ensuring that the code is always exhaustive.

---

### 5. **Type Assertion with `never`**

You can use `never` when performing type assertions in cases where you are sure that certain code paths should never be executed.

#### Example: Type Assertion with `never`

```typescript
function assertNever(x: never): never {
  throw new Error("Unexpected value: " + x);
}

function handleShape(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      // Handle circle
      break;
    case "square":
      // Handle square
      break;
    default:
      assertNever(shape);  // TypeScript will ensure that all cases are handled
  }
}
```

- The `assertNever` function is called if an unhandled case is encountered in the `switch` statement. If you add a new case to the `Shape` type, TypeScript will catch it, and the code will fail to compile until the new case is handled.

---

### 6. **Using `never` for Type Guards**

Sometimes, you may use `never` as part of a type guard function to handle situations where a certain type should never be allowed. For example, when youâ€™re asserting that a variable is a specific type and that no other types should be allowed.

#### Example: Type Guard with `never`

```typescript
function isNumber(value: any): value is number {
  return typeof value === "number";
}

function process(value: any): void {
  if (!isNumber(value)) {
    const _value: never = value;  // If the value is not a number, it must be of type `never`
    throw new Error("Invalid value");
  }
  console.log(value * 2);  // Now `value` is guaranteed to be a number
}
```

- In this case, the `process` function uses a type guard to check if `value` is a number.
- If the value is not a number, we assign it to a `never` type, signaling that it shouldn't happen.

---

### 7. **Summary of `never` Usage**

- **Functions that throw exceptions**: `never` is used as the return type for functions that always throw an error and do not return.
- **Functions with infinite loops**: Any function that runs indefinitely without returning should have the `never` type as its return type.
- **Exhaustiveness checking**: When working with discriminated unions in `switch` statements, `never` ensures all cases are covered.
- **Type assertions and guards**: You can use `never` to indicate unreachable code paths or types that should not exist.

---

### Conclusion

The `never` type in TypeScript is a powerful tool that helps you define cases where values should never occur or where execution should never reach a certain point. It is used to improve the safety and correctness of your code, particularly in functions that throw exceptions, run forever, or in exhaustive checks where every case is expected to be handled. While `never` is not commonly used, it can be essential in enforcing certain program logic that relies on unreachable or unassignable values.
