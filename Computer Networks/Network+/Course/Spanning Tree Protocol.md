### **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**  

The **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** is a network protocol used to prevent **loops** in a Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) network, primarily in Ethernet LANs. Loops in a network can cause broadcast storms, multiple frame copies, and network instability. STP ensures a loop-free topology by selectively blocking redundant paths while keeping one active path between all devices.  

---

### **How STP Works**  

STP uses an algorithm to create a logical loop-free topology:  

1. **Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)**  
   - STP-enabled switches exchange BPDUs to share information about their configuration and detect loops.  

2. **Root Bridge Election**  
   - The switch with the **lowest bridge ID** becomes the **root bridge**.  
   - The bridge ID consists of the bridge priority (default is 32768) and the switch's MAC address.  

3. **Path Cost Calculation**  
   - Each switch calculates the path cost to the root bridge.  
   - Path cost is based on the bandwidth of the links:
     - 10 Mbps = 100 cost
     - 100 Mbps = 19 cost
     - 1 Gbps = 4 cost
     - 10 Gbps = 2 cost  

4. **Port Roles Assignment**  
   - **Root Port (RP)**: The port with the least cost to the root bridge.  
   - **Designated Port (DP)**: The port responsible for forwarding traffic on a specific segment.  
   - **Blocked Port**: Ports not forwarding traffic to avoid loops.  

5. **Forwarding State and Blocking State**  
   - STP transitions ports through different states:
     - **Blocking**: No data is sent or received to prevent loops.
     - **Listening**: The port listens for BPDUs to decide its role.
     - **Learning**: The port learns MAC addresses but doesn't forward data.
     - **Forwarding**: The port forwards data.
     - **Disabled**: The port is administratively turned off.

### **STP Port States**

| **State**     | **Description**                                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Blocking**  | Receives BPDUs but does not forward data packets. Prevents loops.                    |
| **Listening** | Listens for BPDUs to determine the network topology.                                 |
| **Learning**  | Learns MAC addresses but does not forward frames.                                    |
| **Forwarding**| Fully operational; sends and receives frames.                                        |
| **Disabled**  | A manually disabled port; no BPDUs or data traffic is processed.                     |

### **Enhanced Versions of STP**

1. **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)**  
   - An improvement over STP defined in IEEE 802.1w.  
   - Provides faster convergence by reducing port state transitions.  

2. **Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP)**  
   - Defined in IEEE 802.1s.  
   - Supports multiple VLANs by mapping them to a single spanning tree instance.  

3. **Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)**  
   - Cisco proprietary enhancement of STP that allows separate spanning trees for each VLAN.  

---

### **Advantages of STP**

1. **Prevents Broadcast Storms**  
   - By blocking redundant links, STP eliminates broadcast loops.  

2. **Automatic Recovery**  
   - If an active path fails, STP reconfigures the topology to use a backup path.  

3. **Scalability**  
   - Works well in large networks by simplifying the topology.  

---

### **Limitations of STP**

1. **Convergence Time**  
   - Standard STP can take 30-50 seconds to converge (switch all ports to the forwarding state).  
   - RSTP resolves this issue by reducing convergence time.  

2. **Complexity in Large Networks**  
   - Managing and troubleshooting STP in large environments with multiple VLANs can be complex.  

3. **Suboptimal Path Selection**  
   - The algorithm might not always choose the best path in terms of performance.  

---

### **Real-World Example**  

#### **Scenario**:  
A network has three switches connected in a triangle topology:  

- Without STP:  
   - Frames can continuously loop between switches, causing network congestion and broadcast storms.  

- With STP:  
   - One of the redundant links is blocked, creating a loop-free topology.  
   - If the active link fails, the blocked link becomes active to maintain connectivity.

### **Commands to Configure STP (Cisco Example)**  

1. **Enable STP (Default)**  
   ```bash
   switch(config)# spanning-tree mode stp
   ```

2. **Configure RSTP**  
   ```bash
   switch(config)# spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
   ```

3. **Change Bridge Priority (Lower Priority Increases Likelihood of Becoming Root)**  
   ```bash
   switch(config)# spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
   ```

4. **Show STP Status**  
   ```bash
   switch# show spanning-tree
   ```

5. **Manually Block a Port**  
   ```bash
   switch(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   ```
