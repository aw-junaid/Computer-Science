**CouchDB** is an open-source NoSQL database developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed to provide **reliable, scalable**, and **flexible storage** for JSON documents, making it ideal for modern web and mobile applications. CouchDB operates with a schema-free, **document-oriented** model, where data is stored in **JSON** format.

### **Key Features of CouchDB**

1. **Document-Oriented Database**  
   - Data is stored as **JSON documents** with no predefined schema.
   - Each document has a unique identifier (ID) and can include nested fields and arrays.

2. **RESTful HTTP API**  
   - CouchDB uses a RESTful API for all database operations.
   - You can interact with the database via HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

3. **MapReduce for Querying**  
   - CouchDB provides **MapReduce views** to index and query data efficiently.
   - Queries are defined using JavaScript functions.

4. **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**  
   - CouchDB uses MVCC to ensure that multiple users can access and modify data without conflicts.
   - Data is not overwritten but versioned.

5. **Replication**  
   - Supports **incremental replication**, allowing data synchronization between databases, including offline devices.
   - **Master-master replication** ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

6. **Eventual Consistency**  
   - CouchDB follows the **AP** principle of the **CAP theorem**, prioritizing availability and partition tolerance.
   - It embraces **eventual consistency** rather than strict consistency.

7. **Fault Tolerance and Scalability**  
   - Designed to work reliably even with network partitions or hardware failures.
   - Its replication and clustering capabilities make it highly scalable.

8. **Offline-First Development**  
   - CouchDB integrates well with PouchDB (a client-side database), enabling offline-first applications that sync with CouchDB servers.

### **Architecture**

CouchDB's architecture is unique and includes the following components:

- **Storage Engine**: Data is stored as JSON documents on disk using the **append-only** storage model for reliability.
- **B-tree Indexing**: CouchDB uses **B-trees** for indexing documents and views efficiently.
- **HTTP Server**: The built-in HTTP server (based on Erlang) allows CouchDB to serve as a web-accessible database.
- **Views and Queries**: Indexes are generated through **MapReduce** views.

### **When to Use CouchDB?**
CouchDB is suitable for applications that:
- Require offline-first capabilities and synchronization.
- Need distributed, scalable databases with fault tolerance.
- Work with JSON data and rely on RESTful APIs.
- Favor high availability over strong consistency.

**Use Cases**:
- Mobile applications
- Content management systems (CMS)
- Web applications with distributed databases
- IoT applications requiring data sync between devices and servers
