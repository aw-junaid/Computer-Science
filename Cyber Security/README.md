Getting started in cybersecurity can feel daunting, but with a structured approach, it becomes manageable. Here's a guide to help you begin your journey:
---

> Before get into cyber security, ethical hacking or want to become a nerd hacker you must know **Basic of Computer and Networking**:
> 1. Commponets (Ram, CPU and Storage devices)
> 2. Architecture ([How Ram works](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAM-random-access-memory), How data stores in SSD, [**Signal Processing**](https://github.com/arm-university/Digital-Signal-Processing-Education-Kit), [**ARM**](https://github.com/arm-university/Introduction-to-Computer-Architecture-Education-Kit) and [How CPU proccess Data](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-Computer-Architecture-and-Organization?tab=readme-ov-file))
> 3. Programming Languages (C, C++, Python and Javascript)
> 4. [Algorithms and Data Structure](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php)
> 5. [Data Communication and Networking](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/index.htm)

### 2. **Build a Foundation in IT**
   - Study [**CompTIA A+**](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a), [**Network+**](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network), or [**Security+**](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certifications.
   - Understand basic IT concepts like system administration, backups, and software installation.

---

### 3. **Dive into Cybersecurity Concepts**
   - Learn about:
     - [**Common vulnerabilities**](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Hacking-Tools/blob/master/Hacking%20Questions/Top%20100%2B%20Web%20Vulnerabilities%2C%20Categorised%20Into%20Various%20Types%3A.md) ([SQL injection](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp), XSS, etc.).
     - Security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001).
     - Basics of cryptography (hashing, encryption).

---

### 4. **Develop Technical Skills**
   - Learn programming: Python is popular in cybersecurity.
   - Understand how to use cybersecurity tools:
     - Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite.
   - Practice on platforms like:
     - [**TryHackMe**](https://tryhackme.com/), [**Hack The Box**](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [**OverTheWire**](https://overthewire.org/), and [**OWASP Juice Shop**](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).

---

### 5. **Stay Updated**
   - Follow cybersecurity blogs and news sites:
     - [KrebsOnSecurity](https://krebsonsecurity.com/), [Threatpost](https://threatpost.com/), [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/).
   - Join cybersecurity communities:
