C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It was first released in 2000 as part of the .NET framework, and has since evolved to become one of the most widely used programming languages for building a wide range of applications, from desktop and web applications to mobile and cloud-based systems.
