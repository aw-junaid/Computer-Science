### **Android Overview**

**Android** is an open-source, Linux-based operating system designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Developed by **Google** and the **Open Handset Alliance (OHA)**, Android was first released in 2008 and has since become the most widely used mobile operating system globally. It powers billions of devices across a variety of manufacturers, including Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and many others.

Android's flexibility, scalability, and open-source nature have made it a dominant force in the mobile ecosystem, extending beyond smartphones to include smart TVs, wearables (e.g., smartwatches), automotive systems, and IoT devices.

## **Architecture of Android**

The Android operating system is built on a layered architecture, combining components from the Linux kernel, middleware, and application frameworks. Below are the key layers:

### **1. Linux Kernel:**
   - The foundation of Android, providing core system services such as memory management, process management, device drivers, and security.
   - Handles hardware abstraction, allowing Android to run on a wide range of devices.

### **2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):**
   - Provides standard interfaces for hardware vendors to implement drivers for specific devices (e.g., cameras, sensors, GPS).
   - Ensures compatibility between the Android framework and hardware components.

### **3. Native Libraries:**
   - Includes libraries written in C/C++ for tasks like graphics rendering (OpenGL ES), database management (SQLite), and multimedia processing (Media Framework).

### **4. Android Runtime (ART):**
   - Replaces the older Dalvik runtime and improves app performance by compiling apps into native machine code using **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** compilation.
   - Supports garbage collection and efficient memory management.

### **5. Application Framework:**
   - Provides APIs for developers to build apps, including components like:
     - **Activity Manager:** Manages app lifecycle and navigation.
     - **Content Providers:** Enables data sharing between apps.
     - **Notification Manager:** Handles notifications.
     - **Location Manager:** Provides location-based services.

### **6. Applications:**
   - The top layer includes pre-installed apps (e.g., Phone, Contacts, Messages) and third-party apps downloaded from the Google Play Store or other sources.
