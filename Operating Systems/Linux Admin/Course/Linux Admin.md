CentOS (Community ENTerprise Operating System) is a free and open-source Linux distribution that is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It was designed to be a binary-compatible, community-supported version of RHEL, providing a stable and enterprise-ready platform without the cost of RHEL's commercial support.

### Key Features of CentOS:
1. **Binary Compatibility with RHEL**: CentOS is essentially RHEL without the branding and support services. It uses the same code base, making it highly compatible with RHEL-based applications.
  
2. **Stability**: CentOS is known for its stability. It receives regular security updates and bug fixes, making it suitable for production environments.

3. **Security**: CentOS includes security patches and updates, with additional tools such as SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) for enforcing security policies.

4. **Package Management**: CentOS uses the **YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)** package manager, which is used for installing, updating, and managing software packages. The newer CentOS versions (8 and later) use **DNF (Dandified YUM)** as the default package manager, which offers improved performance.

5. **Long-Term Support**: CentOS versions follow RHEL’s lifecycle, providing long-term support. Each major CentOS release typically gets updates for 10 years, with 5 years of full support and 5 years of maintenance support.

6. **Server-Focused**: CentOS is widely used for server environments, such as web servers, application servers, databases, and more. It is commonly used in data centers and enterprise infrastructures.

7. **Virtualization Support**: CentOS supports a wide range of virtualization technologies, including **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)**, **Xen**, and **Docker** containers.

### CentOS Versions:
- **CentOS 7**: Based on RHEL 7, this version uses **Systemd** for init system management, **Firewalld** for firewall configuration, and supports **LVM (Logical Volume Management)** for storage management.
- **CentOS 8**: Based on RHEL 8, with support for newer technologies such as **AppStream**, **Modular Software**, **Cockpit** for system management, and **dnf** as the default package manager.
- **CentOS Stream**: In December 2020, CentOS transitioned to **CentOS Stream** as its main offering, which serves as a rolling-release distribution that sits between Fedora (upstream) and RHEL (downstream), making it a preview of what’s coming in RHEL.

### Key Tools and Commands:
- **YUM/DNF**: Package management tools used for installing, updating, and removing software packages.
  - Example: `dnf install <package_name>`
  - Example: `dnf update` to update the system.
  
- **SELinux**: A security module that provides a set of policies for fine-grained access control.
  - Example: `getenforce` to check the current SELinux status.
  
- **Firewalld**: A firewall management tool that provides a frontend to iptables for managing firewall rules.
  - Example: `firewall-cmd --state` to check the firewall status.
  
- **Systemd**: System and service manager.
  - Example: `systemctl start <service>` to start a service.
  
- **NetworkManager**: Used for managing network connections.
  - Example: `nmcli` to configure network interfaces.

### Use Cases for CentOS:
- **Web Servers**: Often used with Apache, Nginx, or other web server software for hosting websites and web applications.
- **Database Servers**: CentOS is commonly used to host databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.
- **Virtualization**: It supports KVM, VirtualBox, and other virtualization technologies, allowing you to create and manage virtual machines.
- **Development**: Developers often use CentOS for testing applications in an enterprise-like environment before deploying to RHEL.

### Transition to CentOS Stream:
In late 2020, CentOS shifted focus to CentOS Stream, a rolling-release distribution. This transition was met with mixed reactions since CentOS Stream is considered a preview of RHEL, meaning it gets updates and features earlier than CentOS's traditional stable release model. For organizations that require stable, RHEL-like environments, **Rocky Linux** and **AlmaLinux** are alternatives that aim to maintain the original CentOS model of being a downstream, stable version of RHEL.
