**Angular Material - WhiteFrame** is not a standalone component or directive directly available in Angular Material. However, it refers to a style concept in Material Design often used for creating a clean, elevated look for content using a subtle shadow and a white background.

The **WhiteFrame** concept in Material Design essentially refers to a "card-like" UI element that looks as though it's floating above the background, providing an elevated, clean, and modern look. It’s typically achieved using a combination of **elevation** (box-shadow) and a **white background**.

### Implementing WhiteFrame in Angular Material

While Angular Material doesn’t have a specific **`mat-white-frame`** component, the **`mat-card`** component and its elevation capabilities can be used to create a similar effect. Alternatively, you can use CSS for creating custom white frames with elevated shadows.

### 1. **Using `mat-card` with Elevation**

The **`mat-card`** component is part of Angular Material, and you can use it with different elevation levels to simulate a white frame effect.

#### Example: Using `mat-card` to Create a WhiteFrame

```html
<mat-card class="white-frame">
  <mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-title>Card Title</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-subtitle>Card Subtitle</mat-card-subtitle>
  </mat-card-header>
  <mat-card-content>
    This is some content inside the card.
  </mat-card-content>
</mat-card>
```

#### CSS Styling

```css
.white-frame {
  background-color: white;  /* Ensure the background is white */
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);  /* Subtle shadow for elevation */
}
```

- **`mat-card`**: The Material Design card container is used for content grouping.
- **`box-shadow`**: This creates the "floating" effect. You can adjust the shadow's intensity and spread to make it look as subtle or bold as desired.
- **`background-color: white`**: Ensures the card has a clean, white background.

The **elevation** effect is controlled by **`box-shadow`**. Angular Material’s **`mat-card`** component supports the **`elevation`** attribute, which automatically applies different shadow levels based on Material Design guidelines.

#### Example: Using `mat-card` with `elevation`

```html
<mat-card class="white-frame" [ngStyle]="{'box-shadow': '0px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'}">
  <mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-title>Card Title</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-subtitle>Card Subtitle</mat-card-subtitle>
  </mat-card-header>
  <mat-card-content>
    This is some content inside the card.
  </mat-card-content>
</mat-card>
```

### 2. **Custom WhiteFrame Using CSS**

If you prefer a custom **white frame** without using Angular Material's components, you can easily achieve the same effect by styling a div or other container with CSS.

#### Example: Custom WhiteFrame with CSS

```html
<div class="white-frame">
  <h2>Custom WhiteFrame</h2>
  <p>This is a custom white frame with a shadow effect.</p>
</div>
```

#### CSS Styling

```css
.white-frame {
  background-color: white;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);  /* Soft shadow */
  width: 300px;  /* Width of the container */
  margin: 20px;
}
```

- **`background-color: white`**: Ensures the container has a white background.
- **`padding`**: Adds space around the content inside the frame.
- **`border-radius`**: Softens the edges for a modern look.
- **`box-shadow`**: Creates the shadow effect for elevation.

### 3. **Using Elevation in Angular Material**

Angular Material components support **elevation** through classes. You can use the **`mat-elevation-zX`** class, where **X** represents the level of elevation (1 to 24).

#### Example: Using `mat-elevation-z4` with `mat-card`

```html
<mat-card class="mat-elevation-z4">
  <mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-title>Card with Elevation</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-subtitle>Subtitle</mat-card-subtitle>
  </mat-card-header>
  <mat-card-content>
    This is a card with an elevation of z4.
  </mat-card-content>
</mat-card>
```

- **`mat-elevation-z4`**: This class applies a shadow effect that corresponds to an elevation of **4**. You can adjust the level of elevation based on your needs (e.g., **`mat-elevation-z1`** for a small shadow or **`mat-elevation-z24`** for a stronger shadow).

### 4. **Advantages of WhiteFrame Concept**

- **Modern and Clean Look**: The white frame with subtle shadows creates a neat and minimalistic look that is often used in modern UI design.
- **Consistency with Material Design**: It follows the principles of Material Design, which emphasizes clean surfaces, shadows for depth, and clear separations between elements.
- **Performance**: Since it only uses CSS and Angular Material's built-in styles, it is lightweight and does not add significant performance overhead.

### Conclusion

Although there is no direct **WhiteFrame** component in Angular Material, the concept can be easily implemented using **`mat-card`**, **`box-shadow`**, and Angular Material’s elevation system. You can create an elevated white frame by using these built-in components and styles, which helps maintain a consistent and polished UI design while ensuring optimal performance.

Whether you're using Angular Material components like **`mat-card`** or custom div elements with CSS, the **white frame** effect is a great way to create a clean, modern look with subtle depth for your UI.
