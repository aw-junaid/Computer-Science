Serverless Computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, scaling, and provisioning of servers, allowing developers to focus entirely on writing code. In serverless computing, the term "serverless" does not mean there are no servers involved; rather, it means developers do not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
