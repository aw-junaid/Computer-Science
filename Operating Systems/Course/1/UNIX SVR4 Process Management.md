### **UNIX SVR4 Process Management**

**UNIX System V Release 4 (SVR4)** is a significant version of the UNIX operating system that introduced several enhancements and standardizations, particularly in process management. SVR4 combined features from both AT&T's System V and BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) UNIX, making it one of the most influential UNIX versions. Its process management mechanisms laid the foundation for modern UNIX-like systems, including Linux and Solaris.

Below is an in-depth explanation of **process management in UNIX SVR4**, covering key concepts such as process creation, states, scheduling, inter-process communication (IPC), and termination.

## **1. Process Creation**

In UNIX SVR4, processes are created using the `fork()` and `exec()` system calls. These mechanisms allow for flexible process management and are central to UNIX's multitasking capabilities.

### **a. `fork()` System Call**
   - The `fork()` system call creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
   - The new process (child) is an exact copy of the parent process, including its memory, file descriptors, and environment.
   - After `fork()`, both the parent and child processes execute independently.
   - **Return Values:**
     - In the parent process, `fork()` returns the **PID** of the child.
     - In the child process, `fork()` returns `0`.
     - If `fork()` fails, it returns `-1`.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   pid_t pid = fork();
   if (pid == 0) {
       // Child process
       printf("Child process\n");
   } else if (pid > 0) {
       // Parent process
       printf("Parent process, child PID: %d\n", pid);
   } else {
       // Fork failed
       perror("fork");
   }
   ```

### **b. `exec()` System Call**
   - The `exec()` family of system calls replaces the current process image with a new program.
   - Unlike `fork()`, `exec()` does not create a new process; instead, it loads and executes a new program in the same process.
   - Variants include `execl()`, `execv()`, `execle()`, etc., depending on how arguments are passed.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);  // Replace current process with 'ls -l'
   perror("execl");  // If execl fails
   ```

## **2. Process States**

UNIX SVR4 defines several states for processes during their lifecycle. These states represent the current condition of the process as it interacts with the CPU and other resources.

### **a. New:**
   - The process is being created but has not yet started execution.

### **b. Ready:**
   - The process is in the ready queue, waiting to be assigned to a CPU.

### **c. Running:**
   - The process is currently executing on the CPU.

### **d. Waiting/Blocked:**
   - The process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O completion) before it can continue.

### **e. Terminated:**
   - The process has finished execution or has been explicitly killed.

---

## **3. Process Scheduling**

UNIX SVR4 uses a priority-based scheduling algorithm to manage process execution. Processes are assigned priorities, and the scheduler determines which process gets access to the CPU.

### **a. Real-Time Scheduling:**
   - SVR4 introduced support for real-time processes, which have higher priority than normal processes.
   - Real-time scheduling ensures predictable response times for time-critical tasks.

### **b. Time-Sharing Scheduling:**
   - Normal processes are scheduled using a time-sharing algorithm, where CPU time is shared among processes based on their priority and resource usage.

### **c. Priority Levels:**
   - Each process has a priority level, which can be adjusted dynamically by the scheduler.
   - Higher-priority processes are given preference over lower-priority ones.

## **4. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**

UNIX SVR4 provides robust mechanisms for processes to communicate and synchronize their activities. These IPC mechanisms are essential for building complex applications.

### **a. Pipes:**
   - Pipes are unidirectional communication channels between related processes.
   - Data flows from the writer process to the reader process.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   int pipefd[2];
   pipe(pipefd);  // Create a pipe
   ```

### **b. Message Queues:**
   - Message queues allow processes to send and receive messages asynchronously.
   - Messages are stored in a queue until they are read by the receiving process.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   int msgid = msgget(IPC_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);  // Create a message queue
   ```

### **c. Shared Memory:**
   - Multiple processes share a region of memory for fast data exchange.
   - Synchronization mechanisms like semaphores are used to prevent race conditions.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   int shmid = shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, size, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);  // Create shared memory
   ```

### **d. Semaphores:**
   - Semaphores are used for synchronization between processes.
   - They ensure that only one process accesses a shared resource at a time.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   int semid = semget(IPC_PRIVATE, 1, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);  // Create a semaphore
   ```

## **5. Signals**

Signals are a form of inter-process communication used to notify processes of specific events. UNIX SVR4 supports a wide range of signals, each with a predefined purpose.

### **a. Common Signals:**
   - `SIGKILL`: Terminate a process immediately.
   - `SIGTERM`: Request a process to terminate gracefully.
   - `SIGSTOP`: Stop a process.
   - `SIGCONT`: Resume a stopped process.

### **b. Signal Handling:**
   - Processes can define custom signal handlers using the `signal()` or `sigaction()` system calls.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   void handler(int sig) {
       printf("Signal %d received\n", sig);
   }

   signal(SIGINT, handler);  // Handle SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
   ```

---

## **6. Process Termination**

Processes in UNIX SVR4 can terminate in several ways, either voluntarily or involuntarily.

### **a. Normal Termination:**
   - A process terminates normally when it completes its task or explicitly calls `exit()`.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   exit(0);  // Exit with status code 0 (success)
   ```

### **b. Abnormal Termination:**
   - A process may terminate abnormally due to errors, unhandled exceptions, or signals.
   - The `kill()` system call can be used to send signals to terminate a process.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   kill(pid, SIGKILL);  // Send SIGKILL to terminate a process
   ```

### **c. Zombie Processes:**
   - When a child process terminates, it becomes a **zombie process** until the parent collects its exit status using `wait()` or `waitpid()`.

   **Example:**
   ```c
   wait(NULL);  // Parent waits for any child process to terminate
   ```
