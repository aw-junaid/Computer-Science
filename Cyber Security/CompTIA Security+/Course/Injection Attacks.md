### **Injection Attacks**

**Injection attacks** occur when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application by sending untrusted data (often through user inputs) to a system, which is then interpreted or executed as part of a command or query. Injection vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly sanitize or validate input before passing it to an interpreter (e.g., a SQL query, system command, or HTML).

These attacks can be extremely dangerous as they allow attackers to execute malicious commands, retrieve, alter, or delete sensitive data, and compromise the security of the application and its underlying system.

The most common forms of injection attacks include **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Command Injection**, **LDAP Injection**, **XML Injection**, **NoSQL Injection**, and **Code Injection**.

### **Types of Injection Attacks**

#### 1. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
   - **Definition:** SQL Injection occurs when an attacker inserts or manipulates SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into a user input field. If the application fails to properly validate or sanitize input, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, which could lead to unauthorized access to a database, data manipulation, or even deletion.
   - **Example:** An attacker inputs a malicious SQL payload into a login form like `admin' OR '1'='1`. If the application fails to properly handle input, the query might become:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' OR '1'='1' AND password='password';
     ```
     This always returns true and grants the attacker unauthorized access.
   - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, privilege escalation, or complete database compromise.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Use **prepared statements** and **parameterized queries** to separate SQL code from user input.
     - Employ **input validation** to ensure that user inputs are sanitized.
     - Limit database privileges to only what's necessary for the application.

#### 2. **Command Injection**
   - **Definition:** Command injection occurs when an attacker is able to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the host machine by injecting them into an input field. This type of attack exploits insecure system calls where user input is directly passed to system commands without proper validation or sanitization.
   - **Example:** If an application allows users to input a filename that is then passed to a system command, an attacker might input `; rm -rf /` to delete all files on the system.
   - **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, system compromise, data loss, or remote code execution.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - **Avoid using system shell commands** with user input.
     - **Whitelist input** to ensure only expected characters are allowed.
     - Use secure APIs or libraries that do not require direct execution of system commands.

#### 3. **LDAP Injection**
   - **Definition:** LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) injection occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's handling of user input in LDAP queries. If the application constructs LDAP queries with unsanitized user input, an attacker could manipulate the query to bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access to directory information.
   - **Example:** An attacker inputs a string like `*' OR '1'='1` into a search field that constructs LDAP queries. If improperly handled, the query could be executed as:
     ```ldap
     (&(uid=*)(password='*' OR '1'='1'))
     ```
     This would return all directory entries without validating the password.
   - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of LDAP entries, or bypassing authentication.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - **Sanitize input** before using it in LDAP queries.
     - Use **parameterized queries** for LDAP searches, similar to how SQL queries should be parameterized.

#### 4. **XML Injection**
   - **Definition:** XML Injection occurs when an attacker manipulates XML input or a message in a way that causes unintended processing. The attacker may exploit vulnerabilities in the application's XML parsing or validation mechanism to inject malicious content.
   - **Example:** An attacker might inject malicious XML data such as:
     ```xml
     <user><name>admin</name><password>password</password><isAdmin>true</isAdmin></user>
     ```
     If this input is not properly validated, it could give the attacker elevated privileges or bypass authentication.
   - **Impact:** Application misbehavior, unauthorized data access, or manipulation of XML-based configurations.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - **Validate and sanitize XML input** before processing.
     - Use **XML parsers** with secure configurations to prevent injection of malicious XML.
     - Limit the number of recursive XML entities to prevent **billion laughs** or **XML bomb** attacks.

#### 5. **NoSQL Injection**
   - **Definition:** NoSQL injection occurs when an attacker injects malicious NoSQL queries into input fields, exploiting an application's improper validation or handling of data in NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB, or Cassandra).
   - **Example:** An attacker might inject a query like:
     ```json
     {"username": {"$gt": ""}} 
     ```
     If the application directly uses the input in a MongoDB query, it could bypass authentication or retrieve unauthorized data.
   - **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or denial of service.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Use **parameterized queries** with NoSQL databases.
     - Sanitize and validate user input to ensure it adheres to expected patterns.
     - Avoid constructing NoSQL queries directly from user input.

#### 6. **Code Injection**
   - **Definition:** Code injection occurs when an attacker injects malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, or other languages) into the web application. The attacker’s injected code can then be executed within the context of the application, leading to data manipulation, information leakage, or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Example:** If an application allows users to upload files and includes no validation on file extensions or content, an attacker could upload a PHP file with the following code:
     ```php
     <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
     ```
     The attacker could then execute arbitrary shell commands by accessing the file and providing a `cmd` parameter.
   - **Impact:** Remote code execution, data leakage, and system compromise.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - **Validate file uploads** for file types and content.
     - Use **whitelisting** for acceptable file types and content.
     - Implement **strict input validation** and avoid executing user-submitted data as code.

### **How Injection Attacks Work**

Injection attacks work by exploiting the way applications interact with external systems (like databases or command shells) through user input. Here's how an injection attack generally proceeds:

1. **Input Manipulation:** The attacker crafts malicious input that will be executed by the application or the system. This input may be embedded in a web form, URL, or API request.
2. **Vulnerability Exploitation:** If the application does not properly validate or sanitize the input, the attacker’s input will be passed to the interpreter (SQL engine, OS shell, XML parser, etc.) as part of a command or query.
3. **Execution of Malicious Code:** The attacker’s input is executed by the interpreter as if it were legitimate code. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access, retrieve sensitive data, or execute arbitrary commands.
4. **Impact:** Depending on the nature of the injection, the attacker may:
   - Retrieve or alter data (e.g., database records).
   - Execute system commands that affect the underlying host.
   - Bypass authentication mechanisms.
   - Gain full control over the affected system.

### **Mitigation Strategies for Injection Attacks**

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
   - **Whitelist input validation**: Ensure that input matches a predefined format, such as numeric, alphanumeric, or date formats.
   - **Sanitize user input**: Remove or encode any characters that could be interpreted as executable code or commands, such as `;`, `--`, or `<`.
   
2. **Use Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:**
   - Use **prepared statements** for SQL queries, LDAP queries, and other database interactions. This ensures that user input is treated as data rather than part of a command.
   
3. **Avoid Direct Execution of User Input:**
   - Never directly pass user input to system commands, SQL queries, or code execution functions.
   - Use secure libraries or frameworks that handle input safely.

4. **Least Privilege:**
   - Ensure that the application and database have **least privilege** access. For example, the application should not run with administrator or root privileges unless absolutely necessary.
   
5. **Error Handling:**
   - Avoid exposing detailed error messages that could reveal sensitive information, such as the structure of database queries or system configurations.
   - Provide generic error messages that do not include internal data or logic.

6. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
   - Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the application.
   - Perform penetration testing to simulate injection attacks and ensure that mitigation strategies are effective.

7. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Implement a strong **CSP** to restrict what scripts can be executed on your website, thus mitigating the impact of successful injection attacks such as XSS.
