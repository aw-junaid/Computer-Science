### **Public vs. Private Properties in JavaScript**

In JavaScript classes, **public** and **private** properties refer to the visibility and accessibility of the properties within an object. Understanding the differences between these two types of properties helps ensure proper encapsulation and data protection in your classes.

### **1. Public Properties**

Public properties are accessible both inside the class and from outside the class (i.e., through instances of the class). By default, properties defined in a JavaScript class are public unless specifically marked as private.

#### **Characteristics of Public Properties:**
- **Accessible from outside the class:** You can read and modify public properties directly on the instance.
- **Direct access:** No restrictions on the access or modification of the properties.

#### **Example: Public Properties**
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;   // Public property
    this.model = model; // Public property
    this.year = year;   // Public property
  }

  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020);
console.log(myCar.make);  // Toyota (accessible directly)
myCar.make = 'Honda';     // Can be modified directly
console.log(myCar.make);  // Honda (modified directly)
```

- In the example above, `make`, `model`, and `year` are public properties that can be accessed and modified directly from outside the class using the `myCar` instance.

#### **Advantages of Public Properties:**
- Easy to use and access.
- Useful when you don't need to enforce strict control over property access.

#### **Disadvantages of Public Properties:**
- Lack of control over data integrity or validation.
- Can be accidentally modified by external code, potentially leading to bugs or unexpected behavior.

### **2. Private Properties**

Private properties are **only accessible inside the class**. They cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. JavaScript introduces private properties through the `#` syntax (starting from ES2022). Private properties are a key feature of encapsulation in object-oriented programming, ensuring that the internal state of an object is protected from unauthorized external changes.

#### **Characteristics of Private Properties:**
- **Cannot be accessed from outside the class:** They are strictly for internal use within the class.
- **Accessed and modified only via methods:** You can define public methods (like getters and setters) to interact with private properties.

#### **Example: Private Properties**
```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance; // Private property

  constructor(owner, balance) {
    this.owner = owner;
    this.#balance = balance;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance; // Public method to access private field
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    if (amount > 0) {
      this.#balance += amount; // Modify private field
    }
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount <= this.#balance && amount > 0) {
      this.#balance -= amount; // Modify private field
    } else {
      console.log('Insufficient funds or invalid amount.');
    }
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount('John Doe', 1000);
console.log(account.getBalance());  // 1000 (accessing via method)
account.deposit(500);
console.log(account.getBalance());  // 1500
account.withdraw(200);
console.log(account.getBalance());  // 1300

// Trying to access the private field directly will throw an error
console.log(account.#balance);  // SyntaxError: Private field '#balance' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

- **Private properties** are marked with `#` (e.g., `#balance`), and attempts to access or modify them directly from outside the class result in a **syntax error**.

#### **Advantages of Private Properties:**
- **Data protection:** The internal state of the object is not directly accessible or modifiable from outside the class, ensuring data integrity.
- **Encapsulation:** You can control how data is accessed and modified, usually through getters and setters.
- **Security:** Prevents unauthorized or accidental modifications from external code.

#### **Disadvantages of Private Properties:**
- Slightly more complex to implement, requiring getters, setters, or methods for access.
- Cannot be accessed directly by external code, which might feel restrictive in some cases.

### **Comparison: Public vs. Private Properties**

| Feature                  | **Public Properties**                             | **Private Properties**                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Accessibility**         | Can be accessed directly from outside the class. | Can only be accessed inside the class.             |
| **Modification**          | Can be modified directly from outside the class. | Cannot be modified directly from outside the class.|
| **Syntax**                | Normal properties.                               | Marked with `#` (e.g., `#balance`).                 |
| **Encapsulation**         | No encapsulation, can expose data directly.      | Data is encapsulated and protected.                |
| **Control**               | Less control over the data.                      | More control, as access is managed via methods.    |
| **Security**              | Less secure as properties can be modified directly. | More secure as properties cannot be modified externally. |

### **3. Using Getters and Setters with Private Properties**

To provide controlled access to private properties, you can use **getters** and **setters**. Getters allow you to retrieve the value of private properties, while setters allow you to modify them, often with additional logic or validation.

#### **Example: Getters and Setters with Private Properties**
```javascript
class Person {
  #age; // Private property

  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.#age = age;
  }

  // Getter for private #age
  get age() {
    return this.#age;
  }

  // Setter for private #age with validation
  set age(newAge) {
    if (newAge > 0) {
      this.#age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('Age must be a positive number.');
    }
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.#age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person = new Person('Alice', 30);
person.greet(); // Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
console.log(person.age);  // 30 (via getter)
person.age = 35;          // Sets new age
console.log(person.age);  // 35 (updated via setter)
person.age = -5;          // Age must be a positive number.
console.log(person.age);  // 35 (remains unchanged)
```

- **Getters and setters** provide a way to access and modify private properties while allowing additional logic, such as validation or transformation, to be applied.

---

### **Summary**

- **Public Properties:** Accessible and modifiable directly from outside the class. They are not protected and can be changed without restrictions.
- **Private Properties:** Accessible only within the class using `#`. They cannot be modified or accessed directly from outside the class, providing better data protection and encapsulation.
- **Getters and Setters:** Used to provide controlled access to private properties, allowing you to implement logic when getting or setting the value of the properties.

Encapsulation helps in maintaining the integrity of an objectâ€™s data and provides a mechanism for hiding its internal implementation details while exposing a public interface to interact with the object.
