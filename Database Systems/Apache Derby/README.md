Apache Derby is an open-source, relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is written entirely in Java and can be embedded into any Java-based application. Derby is known for its small footprint and ease of use, making it particularly suitable for lightweight, embedded database applications.
