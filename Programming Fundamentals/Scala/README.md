Scala is a general-purpose programming language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It was created by Martin Odersky and first released in 2003. Scala is designed to be concise, elegant, and scalable, hence the name "Scala." It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is fully interoperable with Java, allowing developers to use existing Java libraries and frameworks.
