Processor scheduling is a critical aspect of operating system design that determines how processes are assigned to the CPU for execution. There are several types of processor scheduling algorithms, each with its own approach to managing the execution of processes based on various criteria, such as fairness, efficiency, response time, or priority.

### **Types of Processor Scheduling**

1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling**
   - **Description**: FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm, where processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
   - **How it works**: The first process that arrives is the first to be executed (FIFO: First In, First Out).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple and easy to implement.
     - Fair for processes that arrive at the same time.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Poor performance for processes with varying burst times.
     - Leads to the **convoy effect**, where longer processes can delay the execution of shorter ones.
     - High **waiting time** for processes that arrive after long processes.

2. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling**
   - **Description**: SJF schedules processes based on their burst times, with the process having the shortest burst time selected next.
   - **How it works**: The scheduler looks ahead to find the process that will take the least CPU time to complete and runs it next.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Minimizes **average waiting time** and **turnaround time**.
     - Optimal when burst times are predictable.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires knowing the length of the next CPU burst, which is generally not available.
     - Can lead to **starvation** for longer processes.

3. **Round Robin (RR) Scheduling**
   - **Description**: Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is given a fixed time slice (quantum). After the quantum expires, the process is placed at the end of the ready queue, and the next process is scheduled.
   - **How it works**: Each process runs for a fixed time slice, and if it hasn’t finished, it is placed back in the ready queue for the next round.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Ensures that all processes get a fair share of CPU time.
     - Good for **time-sharing** systems and interactive applications.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - The time quantum must be chosen carefully; too short leads to excessive context switching, while too long can degrade performance to that of FCFS.
     - Can result in **high turnaround time** for processes with shorter burst times.

4. **Priority Scheduling**
   - **Description**: Priority scheduling assigns a priority to each process, and the process with the highest priority is scheduled next.
   - **How it works**: Each process is assigned a priority value, and the scheduler selects the process with the highest priority to run next.
   - **Preemptive Version**: Higher-priority processes can preempt lower-priority processes that are currently running.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Useful for differentiating between important and less critical tasks.
     - Can be adapted for various types of systems (e.g., interactive vs batch jobs).
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Starvation** of low-priority processes can occur if high-priority processes keep coming.
     - Determining accurate priority values can be complex.

5. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
   - **Description**: Multilevel queue scheduling divides processes into multiple queues based on their characteristics (e.g., interactive vs. batch processes) and applies different scheduling algorithms to each queue.
   - **How it works**: Processes are grouped into different queues based on criteria such as priority, interaction level, or resource requirements. Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm, such as FCFS for batch processes and RR for interactive ones.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Allows for different treatment of different types of processes, improving system responsiveness.
     - Provides a more granular control over process scheduling.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Complex to implement.
     - Can be inefficient if too many queues are used or misconfigured.

6. **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**
   - **Description**: This is an enhancement of multilevel queue scheduling. Processes are moved between queues based on their behavior and age. For instance, if a process uses too much CPU time, it may be moved to a lower-priority queue.
   - **How it works**: Processes can move between queues based on factors such as CPU bursts. For example, if a process doesn’t finish quickly, it might be moved to a lower priority queue.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Dynamically adjusts based on process behavior.
     - Prioritizes interactive processes while still allowing CPU-bound processes to complete.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Complex to implement and tune.
     - Might suffer from **starvation** in some cases.

7. **Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling (Real-Time Scheduling)**
   - **Description**: EDF is used in real-time systems where processes (or tasks) must meet strict deadlines. The process with the earliest deadline is given the highest priority.
   - **How it works**: At any given time, the process with the earliest deadline is selected for execution.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Optimal for real-time systems.
     - Guarantees that all processes meet their deadlines, if possible.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Difficult to implement in non-real-time systems.
     - **Context switching** overhead can be significant in systems with a high number of processes.

8. **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) (Real-Time Scheduling)**
   - **Description**: Rate Monotonic Scheduling assigns priorities based on the frequency of tasks. The process with the shortest period (highest frequency) gets the highest priority.
   - **How it works**: Tasks with shorter periods are given higher priorities, and tasks with longer periods are given lower priorities.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple to implement.
     - Optimal for fixed-priority real-time systems.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - May not be optimal for all real-time systems.
     - **Deadlines** may not be met in some cases, especially if the system is overloaded.

9. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling**
   - **Description**: SRTF is a preemptive version of the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. It selects the process with the shortest remaining CPU burst time.
   - **How it works**: The scheduler preempts the running process if another process with a shorter remaining time arrives in the ready queue.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Optimizes **turnaround time** and **waiting time** for short processes.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires knowledge of the remaining burst time.
     - Can cause **starvation** for long processes.

10. **Lottery Scheduling**
    - **Description**: Lottery scheduling is a probabilistic scheduling algorithm where each process is given a lottery ticket, and the process with the winning ticket is selected for execution.
    - **How it works**: Each process is assigned a number of tickets based on its priority. A random ticket is chosen, and the corresponding process is given the CPU.
    - **Advantages**:
      - Fair and flexible, with priorities that can be adjusted dynamically.
      - Simple to implement and adapt.
   - **Disadvantages**:
      - May not guarantee **fairness** or meeting deadlines in real-time systems.

### **Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: In preemptive scheduling, the operating system can interrupt a running process to assign the CPU to another process. Examples include **Round Robin**, **Priority Scheduling (preemptive)**, and **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Better for interactive systems where responsiveness is crucial.
     - Ensures fair CPU time distribution.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Higher overhead due to frequent context switching.

- **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**: In non-preemptive scheduling, once a process starts running, it runs to completion or until it voluntarily gives up the CPU (e.g., by making an I/O request). Examples include **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** and **Priority Scheduling (non-preemptive)**.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Lower overhead from context switching.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - May lead to poor responsiveness, especially for time-sensitive tasks.

### **Summary**

Processor scheduling is a fundamental component of an operating system that determines how processes are allocated to the CPU. The right scheduling algorithm depends on factors like the nature of the system (real-time vs. general-purpose), process priorities, CPU utilization, and fairness. Common algorithms include **FCFS**, **Round Robin**, **Priority Scheduling**, **Shortest Job First**, and **Multilevel Feedback Queue**, each with its strengths and trade-offs.
