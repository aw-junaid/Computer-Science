Developing a complete **OOP-based project** in C++ involves applying the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in a real-world scenario. Let's walk through the steps of developing a **Library Management System** as a practical example. This project will utilize various OOP concepts such as **classes**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction**.

### **Project: Library Management System**

The system will allow users to manage books, members, and staff in a library. It will have functionalities for adding/removing books, registering members, issuing books, and displaying available books.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Define the Classes**
We'll need the following primary classes:

- **Book**: Represents a book in the library.
- **Member**: Represents a library member.
- **Staff**: Represents a staff member who manages books and members.
- **Library**: Manages the entire library, including books and members.

#### **2. Class Design and Methods**
Each class will have attributes and methods to encapsulate its behaviors. We'll implement basic functionalities such as adding books, issuing books, and viewing available books.

---

### **Class Definitions:**

#### **1. Book Class**
The `Book` class represents a book in the library.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

class Book {
private:
    std::string title;
    std::string author;
    bool isIssued;

public:
    Book(std::string t, std::string a) : title(t), author(a), isIssued(false) {}

    std::string getTitle() const {
        return title;
    }

    std::string getAuthor() const {
        return author;
    }

    bool getIssuedStatus() const {
        return isIssued;
    }

    void issue() {
        if (!isIssued) {
            isIssued = true;
            std::cout << "Book '" << title << "' has been issued.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Book '" << title << "' is already issued.\n";
        }
    }

    void returnBook() {
        if (isIssued) {
            isIssued = false;
            std::cout << "Book '" << title << "' has been returned.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Book '" << title << "' was not issued.\n";
        }
    }

    void displayBook() const {
        std::cout << "Title: " << title << ", Author: " << author << ", Issued: " << (isIssued ? "Yes" : "No") << "\n";
    }
};
```

#### **2. Member Class**
The `Member` class represents a library member.

```cpp
class Member {
private:
    std::string name;
    int id;

public:
    Member(std::string n, int i) : name(n), id(i) {}

    std::string getName() const {
        return name;
    }

    int getId() const {
        return id;
    }

    void displayMember() const {
        std::cout << "Member ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << "\n";
    }
};
```

#### **3. Staff Class**
The `Staff` class represents a staff member who can manage books and members.

```cpp
class Staff {
private:
    std::string name;
    int staffId;

public:
    Staff(std::string n, int id) : name(n), staffId(id) {}

    void addBook(std::vector<Book>& library, const Book& book) {
        library.push_back(book);
        std::cout << "Book '" << book.getTitle() << "' added to the library.\n";
    }

    void removeBook(std::vector<Book>& library, const std::string& title) {
        for (auto it = library.begin(); it != library.end(); ++it) {
            if (it->getTitle() == title) {
                library.erase(it);
                std::cout << "Book '" << title << "' removed from the library.\n";
                return;
            }
        }
        std::cout << "Book '" << title << "' not found in the library.\n";
    }

    void issueBook(Book& book) {
        book.issue();
    }

    void returnBook(Book& book) {
        book.returnBook();
    }

    void displayStaff() const {
        std::cout << "Staff ID: " << staffId << ", Name: " << name << "\n";
    }
};
```

#### **4. Library Class**
The `Library` class manages the collection of books and members.

```cpp
class Library {
private:
    std::vector<Book> books;
    std::vector<Member> members;

public:
    void addBook(const Book& book) {
        books.push_back(book);
    }

    void addMember(const Member& member) {
        members.push_back(member);
    }

    void displayBooks() const {
        for (const auto& book : books) {
            book.displayBook();
        }
    }

    void displayMembers() const {
        for (const auto& member : members) {
            member.displayMember();
        }
    }

    Book* findBookByTitle(const std::string& title) {
        for (auto& book : books) {
            if (book.getTitle() == title) {
                return &book;
            }
        }
        return nullptr;
    }
};
```

---

### **3. Main Program**
Now that we have defined the classes, we will create the main function to interact with the library system.

```cpp
int main() {
    // Create library, staff, and members
    Library library;
    Staff staff("Alice", 1001);
    Member member1("Bob", 1);
    Member member2("Charlie", 2);

    // Add books to the library
    library.addBook(Book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald"));
    library.addBook(Book("1984", "George Orwell"));

    // Add members to the library
    library.addMember(member1);
    library.addMember(member2);

    // Display library books and members
    std::cout << "\nLibrary Books:\n";
    library.displayBooks();
    
    std::cout << "\nLibrary Members:\n";
    library.displayMembers();

    // Issue a book
    Book* bookToIssue = library.findBookByTitle("1984");
    if (bookToIssue) {
        staff.issueBook(*bookToIssue);
    }

    // Return the book
    if (bookToIssue) {
        staff.returnBook(*bookToIssue);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **4. Explanation of the Code:**

- **Book Class**: Represents individual books in the library with attributes like title, author, and issue status. The methods `issue()` and `returnBook()` handle book issuance and returns.
- **Member Class**: Represents library members, holding information such as the name and ID of the member.
- **Staff Class**: Represents staff who manage the books and members. Staff can add or remove books, issue, and return books.
- **Library Class**: Manages the library's books and members. It has methods to add and display books and members and to search for books by title.

### **5. Enhancements for Real-World Use:**

- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for cases where the user tries to issue or return a book that doesn't exist.
- **File Storage**: Use file handling (e.g., reading and writing to files) to persist books and members data.
- **Advanced Member Features**: Add more features like issuing multiple books to a member, tracking overdue books, etc.
- **User Interface**: Implement a user interface (CLI or GUI) for more interactive usage of the system.

### **6. Conclusion**
This **Library Management System** project demonstrates how to implement key OOP principles in C++ to build a real-world application. We applied concepts like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction** throughout the design.
