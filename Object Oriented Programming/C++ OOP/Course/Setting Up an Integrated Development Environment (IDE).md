   - Add the compiler path to your system’s environment variables.
4. **Configure Tasks**:
   - Create a `tasks.json` file in the `.vscode` folder of your project to automate build tasks.
   - Example `tasks.json`:
     ```json
     {
         "version": "2.0.0",
         "tasks": [
             {
                 "label": "Build",
                 "type": "shell",
                 "command": "g++",
                 "args": ["-g", "main.cpp", "-o", "main"],
                 "group": {
                     "kind": "build",
                     "isDefault": true
                 }
             }
