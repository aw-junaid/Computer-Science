### **Physical Attacks**  

**Physical attacks** involve direct physical access to systems, devices, or infrastructure to compromise security. Unlike cyberattacks, which operate remotely, physical attacks rely on the attacker being present at or near the target. These attacks can disrupt operations, steal data, or sabotage systems.

### **Types of Physical Attacks**

1. **Theft of Devices**  
   - **Description:** Stealing laptops, smartphones, or removable media (e.g., USB drives) containing sensitive information.  
   - **Impact:** Loss of data, unauthorized access, and potential for further exploitation.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Secure devices with locks or physical restraints.  
     - Use full-disk encryption to protect data.  
     - Implement policies for reporting and responding to theft.

2. **Tampering**

   - **Impact:** Hardware backdoors, data theft, or device malfunction.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Regularly inspect and seal devices.  
     - Use tamper-evident seals.  
     - Monitor for unauthorized access to secure areas.

3. **Destruction or Sabotage**  
   - **Description:** Damaging equipment or facilities to disrupt operations.  
   - **Impact:** Loss of productivity, data, or critical services.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Secure physical locations with surveillance and alarms.  
     - Implement redundancy and disaster recovery plans.  

4. **Access to Unlocked Systems**  
   - **Description:** Exploiting unattended systems that are logged in or unsecured.  
   - **Impact:** Unauthorized data access or malware installation.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Enforce screen lock policies.  
     - Educate employees about securing devices when unattended.

5. **Social Engineering Attacks**  
   - **Description:** Manipulating individuals to gain physical access to restricted areas (e.g., tailgating, impersonation).  
   - **Impact:** Breaches in secure zones or theft of sensitive assets.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Train employees on security policies.  
     - Implement badge-based or biometric access controls.  

6. **USB Drive and Media Attacks**  
   - **Description:** Introducing malicious software through infected USB drives or CDs left in accessible areas.  
   - **Impact:** System infection, data exfiltration, or compromise of entire networks.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Block USB ports where unnecessary.  
     - Train employees not to use unknown devices.  

7. **Eavesdropping Devices**  
   - **Description:** Placing bugs, microphones, or cameras to intercept sensitive conversations or activities.  
   - **Impact:** Leakage of confidential information.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Conduct regular sweeps for surveillance devices.  
     - Secure sensitive meetings and locations.  

8. **Dumpster Diving**  
   - **Description:** Searching through discarded materials for sensitive information.  
   - **Impact:** Retrieval of passwords, account details, or intellectual property.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Shred or securely dispose of sensitive documents.  
     - Use locked bins for document disposal.  

9. **Hardware Installation**  
   - **Description:** Plugging malicious devices like keyloggers, rogue USB drives, or network sniffers into systems.  
   - **Impact:** Data theft or unauthorized access.  
   - **Prevention:**  
     - Restrict physical access to devices.  
     - Use port locks and endpoint security solutions.

   - Implement multi-layered access controls for sensitive zones.  

2. **Surveillance:**  
   - Install cameras, alarms, and motion sensors in key areas.  
   - Monitor live feeds and store footage for review.  

3. **Training and Awareness:**  
   - Educate employees about physical security best practices.  
   - Promote vigilance against tailgating and unauthorized access attempts.  

4. **Secure Equipment:**  
   - Lock devices in secure cabinets when not in use.  
   - Use anti-theft cables for portable devices.  

5. **Destroy Sensitive Data:**  
   - Shred physical documents.  
   - Wipe data from devices before disposal.  

6. **Regular Audits:**  
   - Conduct inspections of physical security measures.  
   - Check for unauthorized hardware or tampering.
