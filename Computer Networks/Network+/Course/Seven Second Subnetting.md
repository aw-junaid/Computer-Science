### **Seven Second Subnetting**

"Seven Second Subnetting" is a simple, mnemonic method for quickly determining the number of subnets and the size of subnets in IPv4 networks. This method is designed to help network engineers quickly perform subnetting without needing to perform detailed binary calculations each time.

The "Seven Second" name comes from the idea that, with practice, you can compute subnets in just a few seconds using a few simple steps.

### **How Seven Second Subnetting Works**

The key idea behind "Seven Second Subnetting" is to break down the subnetting process into a few easy-to-remember steps. Here's how it works:

### **1. Memorize the Subnet Mask Cheat Sheet**
Before you start, you need to memorize a list of common subnet masks and their corresponding properties. This list helps you quickly determine the subnet size and the number of subnets based on the given subnet mask.

| Subnet Mask  | Prefix Length | Number of Subnets | Number of Hosts per Subnet |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 255.255.255.0 | /24           | 1 subnet          | 254 hosts                  |
| 255.255.255.128 | /25          | 2 subnets         | 126 hosts                  |
| 255.255.255.192 | /26          | 4 subnets         | 62 hosts                   |
| 255.255.255.224 | /27          | 8 subnets         | 30 hosts                   |
| 255.255.255.240 | /28          | 16 subnets        | 14 hosts                   |
| 255.255.255.248 | /29          | 32 subnets        | 6 hosts                    |
| 255.255.255.252 | /30          | 64 subnets        | 2 hosts                    |
| 255.255.255.254 | /31          | 128 subnets       | 0 hosts (used for point-to-point) |
| 255.255.255.255 | /32          | 256 subnets       | 0 hosts                    |

### **2. Steps for Subnetting Using Seven Second Subnetting**

Here’s the process to quickly calculate subnets using the "Seven Second Subnetting" method:

1. **Identify the Subnet Mask**: Start by identifying the subnet mask or prefix length that you're working with. This can be given in either dotted decimal format (e.g., `255.255.255.192`) or CIDR notation (e.g., `/26`).
   
2. **Calculate the Number of Subnets**: If you're borrowing bits from the host portion of the address, simply refer to the cheat sheet and count how many subnets are created by the borrowed bits. For example, a `/26` subnet mask (which is `255.255.255.192`) creates **4 subnets**.

3. **Calculate the Number of Hosts**: Similarly, calculate the number of hosts per subnet by using the cheat sheet. For a `/26` subnet mask, each subnet will have **62 usable hosts** (after subtracting 2 for the network and broadcast addresses).

4. **Quick Range Calculation**: You can quickly determine the IP address ranges for each subnet by noting the number of bits borrowed and the number of subnets. This can be done by simply adding the subnet increment based on the number of bits borrowed.

   For example, if you're working with a `/27` subnet mask (which is `255.255.255.224`), you know that:
   - **Subnet increment**: 32 addresses (since `256 - 224 = 32`)
   - The first subnet will range from `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.31`, the second from `192.168.1.32` to `192.168.1.63`, and so on.

### **3. Example: Seven Second Subnetting with /26 Subnet Mask**

Let’s apply the "Seven Second Subnetting" method to an example where the network is `192.168.1.0` with a `/26` subnet mask.

- **Step 1**: The subnet mask `/26` means `255.255.255.192`. According to the cheat sheet:
  - Number of subnets: **4**
  - Number of hosts per subnet: **62**
  
- **Step 2**: To find the subnets:
  - **Subnet 1**: `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.63`
  - **Subnet 2**: `192.168.1.64` to `192.168.1.127`
  - **Subnet 3**: `192.168.1.128` to `192.168.1.191`
  - **Subnet 4**: `192.168.1.192` to `192.168.1.255`

You can quickly create the subnets in just a few seconds using this method.

### **4. Benefits of Seven Second Subnetting**

- **Speed**: As the name suggests, this method allows you to calculate subnets and hosts very quickly.
- **Simplicity**: You only need to memorize the common subnet mask properties. Once you know the cheat sheet, you can easily apply it to most subnetting problems.
- **No Binary Math**: Unlike traditional subnetting methods, you don’t need to manually convert subnet masks to binary, which can save time and reduce complexity.

### **Limitations of Seven Second Subnetting**

- **Limited to Common Subnets**: This method is best suited for networks with standard subnet sizes (like `/24`, `/25`, `/26`, etc.). It may not be as effective for more customized subnetting (e.g., non-standard subnet masks like `/23` or `/29`).
- **Requires Memorization**: You need to memorize the cheat sheet for subnet masks and their corresponding properties.

### **Conclusion**

The "Seven Second Subnetting" method is an effective way to quickly calculate subnets, host counts, and ranges when working with common IPv4 subnet masks. By using a simple cheat sheet and following a few easy steps, you can perform subnetting calculations in a fraction of the time. It’s ideal for network engineers who frequently work with common subnet sizes and need to perform fast calculations on the fly.
