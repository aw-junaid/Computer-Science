### **Achieving Inheritance by Embedding Structures in C**

In C, we don't have native support for **inheritance** as in object-oriented languages like C++ or Java. However, we can **simulate inheritance** by **embedding structures**. This means that one structure can contain another structure as a member, effectively allowing the "derived" structure to inherit the behavior (i.e., fields and functions) of the "base" structure.

### **Steps to Simulate Inheritance by Embedding Structures:**
1. **Define a Base Structure**: The base structure contains common properties and functions that will be shared by derived structures.
2. **Embed the Base Structure in Derived Structures**: The derived structure will include the base structure as a member, effectively inheriting its properties and behaviors.
3. **Extend or Override the Behavior**: The derived structure can add new fields or functions, or modify the behavior of the inherited functions.

### **Example: Simulating Inheritance for Shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle)**

We will simulate inheritance by embedding the `Shape` structure into derived structures (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`). Each derived structure will inherit the properties and methods of the `Shape` structure but can also extend or modify those behaviors.

#### **Code Implementation:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

// Base structure: Shape
typedef struct Shape {
    // Common properties (if any)
    void (*draw)(struct Shape*);  // Virtual function: draw
    double (*area)(struct Shape*); // Virtual function: area
} Shape;

// Derived structure: Circle (inherits from Shape)
typedef struct {
    Shape base;   // Embed Shape structure for inheritance
    double radius;
} Circle;

// Derived structure: Rectangle (inherits from Shape)
typedef struct {
    Shape base;   // Embed Shape structure for inheritance
    double width;
    double height;
} Rectangle;

// Derived structure: Triangle (inherits from Shape)
typedef struct {
    Shape base;   // Embed Shape structure for inheritance
    double baseLength;
    double height;
} Triangle;

// Function implementations for Circle
void drawCircle(Shape* shape) {
    Circle* circle = (Circle*)shape;  // Cast the base pointer to Circle pointer
    printf("Drawing a Circle with radius %.2f\n", circle->radius);
}

double areaCircle(Shape* shape) {
    Circle* circle = (Circle*)shape;  // Cast the base pointer to Circle pointer
    return M_PI * circle->radius * circle->radius;
}

// Function implementations for Rectangle
void drawRectangle(Shape* shape) {
    Rectangle* rectangle = (Rectangle*)shape;  // Cast the base pointer to Rectangle pointer
    printf("Drawing a Rectangle with width %.2f and height %.2f\n", rectangle->width, rectangle->height);
}

double areaRectangle(Shape* shape) {
    Rectangle* rectangle = (Rectangle*)shape;  // Cast the base pointer to Rectangle pointer
    return rectangle->width * rectangle->height;
}

// Function implementations for Triangle
void drawTriangle(Shape* shape) {
    Triangle* triangle = (Triangle*)shape;  // Cast the base pointer to Triangle pointer
    printf("Drawing a Triangle with base %.2f and height %.2f\n", triangle->baseLength, triangle->height);
}

double areaTriangle(Shape* shape) {
    Triangle* triangle = (Triangle*)shape;  // Cast the base pointer to Triangle pointer
    return 0.5 * triangle->baseLength * triangle->height;
}

// Initialize a Circle object
void initCircle(Circle* circle, double radius) {
    circle->radius = radius;
    circle->base.draw = drawCircle;    // Set the function pointer for draw
    circle->base.area = areaCircle;    // Set the function pointer for area
}

// Initialize a Rectangle object
void initRectangle(Rectangle* rectangle, double width, double height) {
    rectangle->width = width;
    rectangle->height = height;
    rectangle->base.draw = drawRectangle;  // Set the function pointer for draw
    rectangle->base.area = areaRectangle;  // Set the function pointer for area
}

// Initialize a Triangle object
void initTriangle(Triangle* triangle, double baseLength, double height) {
    triangle->baseLength = baseLength;
    triangle->height = height;
    triangle->base.draw = drawTriangle;    // Set the function pointer for draw
    triangle->base.area = areaTriangle;    // Set the function pointer for area
}

int main() {
    Circle circle;
    Rectangle rectangle;
    Triangle triangle;

    // Initialize the shapes
    initCircle(&circle, 5.0);
    initRectangle(&rectangle, 4.0, 6.0);
    initTriangle(&triangle, 3.0, 4.0);

    // Array of Shape pointers (base type)
    Shape* shapes[] = {(Shape*)&circle, (Shape*)&rectangle, (Shape*)&triangle};

    // Use inheritance and polymorphism: call the appropriate methods
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        shapes[i]->draw(shapes[i]);        // Calls the specific draw function
        printf("Area: %.2f\n", shapes[i]->area(shapes[i]));  // Calls the specific area function
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Base Structure (`Shape`)**:
   - The `Shape` structure defines common behavior (i.e., `draw()` and `area()`) using function pointers. This structure acts as a **base class** that provides a "contract" for all derived shapes to follow.

2. **Derived Structures**:
   - `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` structures **embed** the `Shape` structure as a member (`base`). This gives the derived structures access to the `draw()` and `area()` functions and allows them to "inherit" this behavior.

3. **Function Implementations**:
   - `drawCircle()`, `areaCircle()`, `drawRectangle()`, `areaRectangle()`, `drawTriangle()`, and `areaTriangle()` provide specific implementations of the `draw()` and `area()` functions for each shape.

4. **Initialization**:
   - In the `initCircle()`, `initRectangle()`, and `initTriangle()` functions, we assign the appropriate function pointers (`draw` and `area`) to the base structure's function pointers. This ensures that when we call `draw()` and `area()` on a base class pointer (`Shape*`), the correct version of the function is invoked for the objectâ€™s type.

5. **Polymorphism**:
   - The `main()` function demonstrates polymorphism. Even though we store pointers to the derived objects in an array of `Shape*` (base type), the correct `draw()` and `area()` functions are called based on the actual type of the object, thanks to function pointers.

### **Output:**

```
Drawing a Circle with radius 5.00
Area: 78.54
Drawing a Rectangle with width 4.00 and height 6.00
Area: 24.00
Drawing a Triangle with base 3.00 and height 4.00
Area: 6.00
```

### **Advantages of Using Structure Embedding to Simulate Inheritance:**

1. **Code Reusability**:
   - By embedding the base structure, the derived structures inherit the common behavior defined in the base structure. This allows you to reuse code, making it more maintainable.

2. **Extensibility**:
   - You can easily extend the system by adding new derived structures (e.g., `Square` or `Polygon`) without modifying the base structure or the rest of the program. This provides a flexible way to extend functionality.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - The base structure (`Shape`) defines a contract that all derived structures must follow, ensuring that the functionality for drawing and calculating area is consistent across different shape types.

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - By embedding function pointers in the base structure, you can achieve **polymorphism**, allowing objects of different types to respond to the same method call appropriately at runtime.

### **Conclusion:**

By **embedding structures** in C, we can effectively simulate **inheritance**. While C is not an object-oriented language, this technique provides a powerful way to structure code in a modular, extensible, and reusable manner. This approach allows us to mimic important OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism without needing complex language features like classes.
