# **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)** ðŸš€

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** is an essential part of modern software development workflows. It allows teams to integrate code into a shared repository and automatically deploy it to production. This ensures faster development cycles and higher code quality. Two of the most popular CI/CD tools are **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**.

In this guide, we will explore both tools, focusing on how they help automate build, test, and deployment processes.

## **1. Introduction to CI/CD Pipelines**

### **What is Continuous Integration (CI)?**
- **Continuous Integration** refers to the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline multiple times a day.
- In CI, developers frequently commit their changes, and the system runs automated tests to detect issues early in the development cycle.

### **What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?**
- **Continuous Deployment** extends CI by automatically deploying code to production after passing tests.
- This eliminates the manual step of deploying code, ensuring that every change is reflected in the production environment as soon as itâ€™s ready.

## **2. CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

**GitHub Actions** is a powerful CI/CD tool integrated directly into GitHub, allowing you to automate workflows like building, testing, and deploying your code. It's easy to set up and provides flexibility for developers who already use GitHub.

### **Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:

1. **Create a Workflow Configuration File**:
   GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows. These files are stored in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository.

   Example `ci.yml` file for Node.js application:
   ```yaml
   name: Node.js CI

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout repository
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v2
         with:
           node-version: '14'

       - name: Install dependencies
         run: npm install

       - name: Run tests
         run: npm test

       - name: Build
         run: npm run build
         
       - name: Deploy to production
         if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
         run: ./deploy.sh
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **name**: Specifies the name of the workflow.
   - **on**: Defines the events that trigger the workflow (e.g., `push` to the `main` branch).
   - **jobs**: Defines the steps of the workflow.
   - **actions/checkout**: Checks out the code from your GitHub repository.
   - **actions/setup-node**: Sets up the Node.js environment.
   - **run**: Defines the shell commands to install dependencies, run tests, and build the application.
   - **Deploy to production**: You can deploy the application to your production environment with custom commands (e.g., calling a deployment script `./deploy.sh`).

2. **Triggering the Workflow**:
   - When a change is pushed to the `main` branch (or any specified branch), this workflow will trigger.
   - The workflow will run through the steps: checkout code, set up Node.js, install dependencies, run tests, and deploy.

3. **Monitoring the Workflow**:
   - Once the workflow is triggered, you can monitor the build, test, and deployment status in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.
   - GitHub provides a visual representation of your workflow's success or failure.

4. **Customizing the Workflow**:
   - You can extend your workflow by adding more steps (e.g., static code analysis, linting, or notifications to Slack on success/failure).

## **3. CI/CD with Jenkins**

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server widely used for CI/CD pipelines. It is more flexible than GitHub Actions and works well in large enterprise environments. It provides support for a wide range of plugins, which allow you to integrate various tools into your CI/CD pipeline.

### **Setting Up CI/CD with Jenkins**:

1. **Install Jenkins**:
   - You can install Jenkins on your local machine or a server.
   - Visit [Jenkins installation page](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to set it up.

2. **Create a New Jenkins Job**:
   - Once Jenkins is installed, navigate to the Jenkins dashboard and click on **New Item**.
   - Select **Freestyle project** or **Pipeline** depending on your needs.
   - For a simple build and deploy pipeline, select **Freestyle project**.

3. **Configure the Job**:
   - **Source Code Management**:
     - Select the **Git** option for source code management and enter your repository URL.
     - Configure credentials if necessary to access private repositories.
   
   - **Build Triggers**:
     - You can set up build triggers like **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** or use **polling the SCM** to periodically check for new commits.
   
   - **Build Steps**:
     You can configure various build steps, such as:
     - **Execute shell**: To run commands like `npm install` or `npm run build`.
     - **Invoke Ant**: If you're using Ant to build Java projects.
   
   - **Post-build Actions**:
     Add actions for **notifying users** or **deploying** your app. Jenkins has plugins for integration with Slack, email notifications, and various deployment platforms.

4. **Jenkins Pipeline (Advanced)**:
   Jenkins also supports **Pipeline as Code** through **Jenkinsfile**, a text file that contains the pipeline definitions.
   
   Example of a simple **Jenkinsfile** for a Node.js app:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any

       stages {
           stage('Checkout') {
               steps {
                   git 'https://github.com/your-repo-url'
               }
           }

           stage('Install Dependencies') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm install'
               }
           }

           stage('Run Tests') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm test'
               }
           }

           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm run build'
               }
           }

           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   sh './deploy.sh'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The `pipeline` block defines the stages of the CI/CD process.
   - Each `stage` defines specific tasks such as `Checkout`, `Install Dependencies`, `Run Tests`, `Build`, and `Deploy`.

5. **Running the Pipeline**:
   - Once youâ€™ve configured the Jenkins job, click **Build Now** to manually trigger the pipeline or configure automatic triggers (e.g., on every commit or pull request).

6. **Monitoring Jenkins Jobs**:
   - You can monitor the progress of Jenkins builds through the **Build History** in the Jenkins dashboard. Jenkins provides detailed logs for each build and step.

7. **Deploying with Jenkins**:
   - Jenkins can deploy your app using SSH, FTP, or any other tool through plugins or custom scripts. You can configure Jenkins to deploy to servers like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.

## **5. Best Practices for CI/CD Pipelines**

- **Automate Everything**: From testing to deployment, automate as much of your process as possible to ensure consistency and reduce human errors.
- **Small, Frequent Commits**: Make smaller, more frequent commits to avoid large merge conflicts and to help speed up the feedback loop.
- **Isolated Environments**: Use Docker containers or virtual environments to ensure that your tests and builds are consistent across environments.
- **Test First**: Prioritize running tests early in your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues before deployment.
- **Fail Fast**: If a step fails (e.g., a test), halt the pipeline to avoid wasting resources on unnecessary steps.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor your pipelines, deployments, and production environments to catch issues in real time.
