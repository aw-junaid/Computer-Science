"Instruction Execution" refers to the process by which a computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit) fetches, decodes, and executes machine instructions. This is a fundamental concept in computer architecture and assembly language.  

### **Stages of Instruction Execution**  
The process typically follows these steps:  

1. **Fetch**: The CPU retrieves the instruction from memory (from the address stored in the Program Counter, PC).  
2. **Decode**: The instruction is interpreted to determine the operation and operands.  
3. **Execute**: The CPU performs the operation (e.g., arithmetic, memory access, control transfer).  
4. **Write Back**: The result of execution (if any) is written to a register or memory.  
5. **Update PC**: The PC is updated to point to the next instruction (unless altered by a jump or branch).  

### **Types of Instruction Execution**  
- **Arithmetic & Logical Instructions** (e.g., ADD, SUB, AND, OR)  
- **Data Transfer Instructions** (e.g., MOV, LDR, STR)  
- **Control Flow Instructions** (e.g., JMP, CALL, RET)
