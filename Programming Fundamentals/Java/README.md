- `this` and `super` keywords
- Static and instance members
- Packages and import statements

---

### **4. Advanced OOP Concepts**
- Method overriding and runtime polymorphism
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Inner classes (nested, local, anonymous, and static nested classes)
- Enumerations (enums)
- Generics and type parameters
- Exception handling:
  - `try`, `catch`, `finally`
  - Custom exceptions
  - Checked vs. unchecked exceptions

---

### **5. Java Collections Framework**
- Overview of the Collections API
- Lists (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`)
- Sets (`HashSet`, `TreeSet`)
- Maps (`HashMap`, `TreeMap`)
- Iterators and iterable interfaces
- Sorting and searching collections
- Lambda expressions and functional interfaces

---

### **6. Input/Output (I/O) and File Handling**
- Streams (byte streams and character streams)
- Reading and writing files
- Serialization and deserialization
- Working with `File`, `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, etc.
- Handling exceptions in I/O operations

---

### **7. Multithreading and Concurrency**
- Introduction to threads
- Creating threads (extending `Thread` class and implementing `Runnable`)
- Thread lifecycle and states
- Synchronization and thread safety
- `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods
- Thread pools and executors
- Concurrent collections

---

### **8. Networking in Java**
- Basics of networking
