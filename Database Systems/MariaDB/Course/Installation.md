### MariaDB Installation

The installation of MariaDB depends on the operating system you're using. Below are the instructions for installing MariaDB on various platforms:

---

### 1. **MariaDB Installation on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

#### Step 1: Update the Package Index
First, ensure that your system’s package index is updated:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

#### Step 2: Install MariaDB Server
To install the MariaDB server package, run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install mariadb-server
```

#### Step 3: Secure MariaDB Installation
Once installed, run the security script to set up a root password and remove insecure default settings:
```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

This script will ask you several questions (like whether to enable the VALIDATE PASSWORD plugin, set a root password, and remove test databases).

#### Step 4: Start and Enable MariaDB Service
Start the MariaDB service and enable it to start on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

#### Step 5: Verify Installation
To verify that MariaDB is installed and running, you can check its status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

Alternatively, login to the MariaDB shell:
```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
You'll be prompted to enter the root password.

### 2. **MariaDB Installation on CentOS/RHEL/Fedora**

#### Step 1: Install MariaDB Server
First, install MariaDB using the system’s package manager:
```bash
sudo yum install mariadb-server
```

On newer versions of CentOS (8) or RHEL, use `dnf` instead of `yum`:
```bash
sudo dnf install mariadb-server
```

#### Step 2: Start and Enable MariaDB Service
Start MariaDB and enable it to start at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

#### Step 3: Secure the Installation
Run the secure installation script to set a root password and remove insecure defaults:
```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

#### Step 4: Verify Installation
Check the status of MariaDB to ensure it's running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

To log in to the MariaDB shell:
```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

### 3. **MariaDB Installation on macOS**

#### Step 1: Install Homebrew
If you haven't installed Homebrew, the package manager for macOS, do so by following the instructions on [Homebrew's website](https://brew.sh/) or running the following command:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Step 2: Install MariaDB Using Homebrew
Once Homebrew is installed, you can easily install MariaDB with the following command:
```bash
brew install mariadb
```

#### Step 3: Start and Enable MariaDB
Start the MariaDB service:
```bash
brew services start mariadb
```

#### Step 4: Secure the Installation
Run the security script:
```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

#### Step 5: Verify Installation
To check if MariaDB is running:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

### 4. **MariaDB Installation on Windows**

#### Step 1: Download the MariaDB Installer
Go to the official MariaDB download page: [MariaDB Downloads](https://mariadb.org/download/) and download the Windows installer.

#### Step 2: Run the Installer
Run the downloaded installer and follow the setup instructions. You can choose the default installation options unless you need to customize settings (like setting a root password).

#### Step 3: Start MariaDB
Once installed, MariaDB should automatically start. You can check by looking for the MariaDB service in the Windows services list (Search for `services.msc`).

#### Step 4: Verify Installation
To verify the installation, open Command Prompt and run:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Enter the root password that you set during the installation process.

### 5. **MariaDB Installation Using Docker (Cross-platform)**

If you prefer using Docker, you can run MariaDB in a container. 

#### Step 1: Pull the MariaDB Docker Image
```bash
docker pull mariadb
```

#### Step 2: Run a MariaDB Container
To start a MariaDB container with a root password, use the following command:
```bash
docker run --name mariadb-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mariadb
```
Replace `my-secret-pw` with a strong root password.

#### Step 3: Connect to MariaDB
You can connect to the MariaDB container using:
```bash
docker exec -it mariadb-container mysql -u root -p
```
