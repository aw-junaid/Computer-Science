### **Wireless Disassociation Attacks**

A **Wireless Disassociation Attack** is a type of attack that targets **Wi-Fi networks**, specifically exploiting the **Wi-Fi disassociation** process. It aims to force a device or client to disconnect from a wireless network by sending fake deauthentication or disassociation frames, which results in the targeted device being kicked off the network. The attacker can then perform additional malicious actions like eavesdropping, conducting Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, or further compromising the network.

### **How Wireless Disassociation Attacks Work**

1. **Wi-Fi Protocol Overview**:
   - In the **IEEE 802.11** wireless networking standard, **disassociation** and **deauthentication** frames are used as part of the process for a client device (like a laptop or smartphone) to disconnect from a Wi-Fi access point (AP).
   - A **disassociation frame** is sent by the AP to tell a device it is no longer part of the network.
   - A **deauthentication frame** is used to terminate an existing session, signaling that the device must re-authenticate to the network if it wants to reconnect.

2. **Exploitation**:
   - In a disassociation attack, an attacker sends forged **deauthentication** or **disassociation frames** to a targeted device (or multiple devices) connected to a wireless network.
   - These frames appear to come from the legitimate access point, even though the attacker is not the AP. The targeted device thinks it has been ordered to disconnect from the network and stops communication with the AP.
   - The attacker can then either:
     - **Intercept traffic** from the disconnected device if it attempts to reconnect (MITM).
     - **Flood the device with fake disassociation frames**, causing a **denial of service (DoS)** by preventing it from rejoining the network.

3. **Attack Execution**:
   - **Attacker Device Setup**: The attacker must be within range of the Wi-Fi network and its devices. They typically use tools like **Aircrack-ng**, **MDK3**, or **Kismet** to send fake deauthentication frames.
   - **Frame Injection**: The attacker sends specially crafted frames that mimic legitimate disassociation or deauthentication messages from the AP, forcing the device to disconnect.
   - **Client Reconnection**: After the disassociation, the targeted device may try to reconnect to the network, where the attacker could potentially capture or redirect its traffic if they are conducting a MITM attack.

### **Impact of Wireless Disassociation Attacks**

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The device is disconnected from the Wi-Fi network and may be unable to reconnect until the attack stops. This can cause service disruption, especially in environments where constant network connectivity is required.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: If the victim device attempts to reconnect to the network, the attacker may impersonate the AP and trick the device into connecting to a rogue access point, giving the attacker the ability to intercept and manipulate traffic.
- **Network Disruption**: For larger-scale attacks targeting multiple clients, a disassociation attack can cause widespread disconnections, potentially affecting all devices on a Wi-Fi network and causing significant service disruption.
- **Credential Harvesting**: Once a victim device is disconnected and re-authenticated to the rogue AP, the attacker can capture sensitive information, including login credentials or session cookies.

### **Mitigation and Prevention**

1. **Use Strong Encryption**:
   - **WPA3**: The latest Wi-Fi security standard, **WPA3**, provides better protection against disassociation attacks, especially with stronger encryption and more secure key management compared to its predecessors (WPA2).
   - **WPA2** with **AES encryption** is a minimum standard for securing Wi-Fi networks.

2. **Enable 802.11w (Management Frame Protection)**:
   - The **802.11w** standard provides **management frame protection**, which secures the management frames (like deauthentication and disassociation frames) from tampering and forgery.
   - This helps prevent attackers from injecting fake frames and disconnecting devices from the network.

3. **Monitor Wireless Traffic**:
   - Regular monitoring of the wireless network can help detect abnormal activity, such as unusual numbers of disassociation frames or unexplained disconnects. Tools like **Wireshark** or **Snort** can be used to monitor for signs of an ongoing disassociation attack.

4. **Use Enterprise-Grade Solutions**:
   - In enterprise environments, use **RADIUS** servers and **WPA2-Enterprise** or **WPA3-Enterprise** for stronger security and user authentication, which makes it harder for attackers to spoof legitimate devices and access points.

5. **Limit Device Visibility**:
   - Set devices to **non-discoverable mode** to limit their exposure to attacks. This reduces the ability of attackers to easily identify devices within range.

6. **Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**:
   - Use **IDS** systems to detect and alert administrators about unusual network activities that could indicate an attack, such as frequent deauthentication frames or unauthorized access point requests.

7. **Rogue Access Point Detection**:
   - Implement tools that can detect rogue access points in the area, reducing the likelihood that attackers can set up a malicious AP to lure disconnected devices.

### **Real-World Example**

In a **public Wi-Fi environment** (e.g., a coffee shop), an attacker may deploy a wireless disassociation attack on several customer devices. After the devices disconnect, the attacker could set up a rogue access point with the same SSID as the legitimate network and trick the users into connecting to it. While the devices reconnect, their data, including login credentials or session tokens, may be intercepted by the attacker.

### **Conclusion**

Wireless Disassociation Attacks are a form of **denial of service** that target the **disconnection** process in Wi-Fi networks, potentially leading to service disruption and security risks such as **Man-in-the-Middle** attacks. While the attack itself does not compromise the network directly, it can serve as a stepping stone for other malicious activities, such as data interception or network infiltration. To mitigate these attacks, organizations should implement modern security protocols like **WPA3**, enable **802.11w** management frame protection, and monitor network traffic for unusual behavior.
