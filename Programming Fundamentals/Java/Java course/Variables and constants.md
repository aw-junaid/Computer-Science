In Java, **variables** and **constants** are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. Understanding how to declare, initialize, and use variables and constants is fundamental to writing Java code.

### **1. Variables**
A variable is a named memory location that stores data. The value of a variable can change during the execution of a program.

#### **Syntax for Declaring a Variable**
```java
dataType variableName;
```
- **dataType**: The type of data the variable can hold (e.g., `int`, `double`, `String`).
- **variableName**: The name of the variable (must follow Java naming conventions).

#### **Syntax for Initializing a Variable**
```java
dataType variableName = value;
```
- **value**: The initial value assigned to the variable.

#### **Example**:
```java
int age; // Declaration
age = 25; // Initialization

double salary = 50000.50; // Declaration and initialization
String name = "John"; // Declaration and initialization
```

---

### **2. Constants**
A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned. In Java, constants are declared using the `final` keyword.

#### **Syntax for Declaring a Constant**
```java
final dataType CONSTANT_NAME = value;
```
- **final**: Indicates that the value cannot be changed.
- **CONSTANT_NAME**: By convention, constant names are written in uppercase with underscores separating words.

#### **Example**:
```java
final double PI = 3.14159;
final int MAX_USERS = 100;
```

---

### **3. Variable Naming Conventions**
- Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (`_`), or dollar sign (`$`).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names.
- Follow **camelCase** for variable names (e.g., `myVariableName`).

#### **Valid Examples**:
```java
int age;
String firstName;
double accountBalance;
```

#### **Invalid Examples**:
```java
int 2age; // Cannot start with a digit
String first-name; // Hyphen is not allowed
double class; // 'class' is a reserved keyword
```

---

### **4. Types of Variables**
In Java, variables can be classified into three types based on their scope:

#### **a. Local Variables**
- Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.
- Must be initialized before use.
- Scope is limited to the block in which they are declared.

#### **Example**:
```java
public void myMethod() {
    int localVar = 10; // Local variable
    System.out.println(localVar);
}
```

#### **b. Instance Variables**
- Declared inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block.
- Belong to an instance of the class.
- Initialized with default values if not explicitly assigned.

#### **Example**:
```java
class Person {
    String name; // Instance variable
    int age; // Instance variable
}
```

#### **c. Static Variables**
- Declared with the `static` keyword.
- Belong to the class rather than any instance.
- Shared among all instances of the class.

#### **Example**:
```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // Static variable
}
```

### **5. Example Program**
Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates variables and constants:

```java
public class Main {
    // Instance variable
    int instanceVar = 20;

    // Static variable
    static int staticVar = 30;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Local variable
        int localVar = 10;

        // Constant
        final double PI = 3.14159;

        System.out.println("Local Variable: " + localVar);
        System.out.println("Instance Variable: " + new Main().instanceVar);
        System.out.println("Static Variable: " + staticVar);
        System.out.println("Constant: " + PI);
    }
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Local Variable: 10
Instance Variable: 20
Static Variable: 30
Constant: 3.14159
```

### **6. Key Points**
- **Variables** are used to store data that can change during program execution.
- **Constants** are used to store data that remains unchanged throughout the program.
- Use meaningful names for variables and constants.
- Follow Java naming conventions for readability and maintainability.

### **Conclusion**
Variables and constants are essential building blocks in Java programming. By understanding how to declare, initialize, and use them, you can effectively manage data in your programs. Whether you're working with local variables, instance variables, or constants, these concepts will help you write clean and efficient code.
