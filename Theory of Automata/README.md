# Theory of Automata

The **Theory of Automata** course is a foundational subject in computer science, often part of the curriculum for undergraduate and graduate studies. Below is a general outline of the course content:

---

### **1. Introduction to Automata**
- Definition and significance of automata theory in computer science.
- Applications of automata in real-world problems.
- Basic terminologies: symbols, alphabets, strings, and languages.

---

### **2. Finite Automata (FA)**
- **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA):**
  - Formal definition and structure.
  - Construction examples.
  - Transition tables and diagrams.
  - Language recognition by DFA.

- **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA):**
  - Definition and examples.
  - Equivalence between DFA and NFA.
  - Conversion of NFA to DFA.

- **Finite Automata with ε-moves (ε-NFA):**
  - Role of ε-moves.
  - Conversion of ε-NFA to NFA and DFA.

---

### **3. Regular Languages**
- Definition and properties.
- Regular operations: union, concatenation, and Kleene star.
- Closure properties of regular languages.
- Regular expressions (RE):
  - Syntax and usage.
  - Equivalence between RE and finite automata.
- Applications of regular languages (e.g., lexical analysis).

---

### **4. Non-Regular Languages**
- The pumping lemma for regular languages.
- Examples of non-regular languages.
- Decision properties for regular languages (e.g., membership, emptiness, equivalence).

---

### **5. Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**
- Definition and components: variables, terminals, productions, and start symbol.
- Derivations and parse trees.
- Leftmost and rightmost derivations.
- Ambiguity in grammars.
