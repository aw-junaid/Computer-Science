Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the management of IT infrastructure. It allows system administrators and developers to automate tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration of complex workflows. Ansible uses a declarative approach to define the desired state of a system and then ensures that the system is configured accordingly.
