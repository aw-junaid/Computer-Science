Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is widely used for building web applications due to its simplicity and scalability. Below are the basics of Django to help you get started:

### 1. **Installation**:
You can install Django using `pip`:
```bash
pip install django
```

### 2. **Creating a Project**:
Once Django is installed, you can create a new project by running:
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```
This creates a new directory with the necessary files and settings for your project.

### 3. **Starting the Development Server**:
Navigate into your project directory and run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
By default, the server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 4. **Creating an Application**:
In Django, a project can consist of one or more apps. To create an app within your project:
```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```
This creates a new directory with files for models, views, and other components of the app.

### 5. **Models**:
Models define the structure of your database. Hereâ€™s an example of a basic model in `models.py`:
```python
from django.db import models

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

### 6. **Migrations**:
After defining models, you'll need to create and apply migrations to sync the database:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. **Admin Interface**:
Django comes with a built-in admin interface that allows you to manage your database through a web interface. To enable it, register your models in `admin.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```
To access the admin interface, create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. **Views**:
Views are functions or classes that handle user requests and return responses. Here's an example of a basic view:
```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

def home(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'posts': posts})
```

### 9. **URLs**:
You define the URL patterns in Django in the `urls.py` file. For example:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

### 10. **Templates**:
Django uses a template language for rendering HTML. You can create templates in a directory called `templates` within your app. Here's an example of a basic template:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Posts</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Posts</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for post in posts %}
            <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

### 11. **Static Files**:
For static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images), you can use the `static` folder. You can reference static files in templates like this:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'styles.css' %}">
```

### 12. **Django Shell**:
Django provides an interactive shell for working with your models and the database:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

### 13. **Deployment**:
Once your app is ready, you can deploy it to various hosting platforms such as Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS. You'll typically need to configure your settings (like `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, database settings, and static files) for production.
