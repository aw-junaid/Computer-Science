### **Wired Network Troubleshooting**

Wired network troubleshooting involves diagnosing and resolving issues related to physical connections, network devices, and configurations in a wired network environment. Since most wired networks rely on Ethernet cables, switches, routers, and network interface cards (NICs), the troubleshooting process typically focuses on these components. Here are key steps and techniques for troubleshooting wired networks.

### **1. Check Physical Layer Connections**

The first step in troubleshooting is to ensure that the physical connections are intact. This involves checking cables, connectors, and network interfaces.

#### **Key Checks:**
- **Ethernet Cable**: Verify that cables are securely plugged into the network devices (e.g., router, switch, or computer) and that they are not damaged.
- **Cable Type**: Ensure that the correct type of Ethernet cable (Cat5e, Cat6, or higher) is being used for the required speed and distance.
- **Connector Type**: Confirm that RJ45 connectors are properly crimped and seated in the network jacks.
- **Physical Damage**: Inspect the cables for any physical damage (cuts, kinks, or frays) that may cause intermittent or complete loss of connectivity.

#### **Tools:**
- **Cable Tester**: A cable tester helps identify wiring issues in Ethernet cables, such as broken wires or miswiring in the connectors.

### **2. Verify Device Connectivity**

After ensuring that the cables are correctly connected, the next step is to check the connectivity between devices.

#### **Key Checks:**
- **Link Light Indicators**: Check the LEDs on network devices (e.g., NIC, switch, or router). Most devices have a link light that indicates whether a physical connection is established.
  - **Solid Light**: Indicates a successful connection.
  - **Blinking Light**: Typically indicates activity or data transmission.
  - **No Light**: No link or connectivity problem.

- **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: Ensure that the NIC is functioning correctly. If the NIC has a malfunction or is disabled, you may need to reset or replace it.
  
#### **Tools:**
- **ping**: Use the `ping` command to check connectivity between devices on the local network (e.g., ping the router’s IP address or a connected computer).
  
  ```bash
  ping 192.168.1.1  # Ping the router or switch
  ```

### **3. Check for IP Address Conflicts**

IP address conflicts occur when two devices on the same network are assigned the same IP address. This can lead to connectivity issues as only one device can use a specific IP address at a time.

#### **Key Checks:**
- **Check IP Configuration**: Ensure that devices are assigned unique IP addresses. This can be done using `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS).
  
  ```bash
  ipconfig   # Windows
  ifconfig   # Linux/macOS
  ```
  
- **DHCP**: If devices are configured to use DHCP, ensure that the DHCP server is functioning correctly and there are no conflicts or exhaustion of IP address pools.
- **Static IPs**: If static IP addresses are used, verify that they don’t overlap with other devices on the network.

### **4. Verify Switch and Router Configuration**

Wired network issues can also arise from misconfigured network devices, such as switches or routers. Incorrect settings can result in packet loss, slow performance, or no connectivity.

#### **Key Checks:**
- **VLAN Configuration**: Ensure that the correct VLAN settings are configured on the switch, especially in larger networks. VLAN misconfigurations can prevent devices from communicating.
- **Port Security**: If port security is enabled, ensure that the correct MAC addresses are allowed on each switch port.
- **Routing Configuration**: Verify routing settings on routers, ensuring they are properly configured to route traffic between different subnets.
- **Switch Ports**: Check if the correct ports are being used and are set up correctly (speed, duplex settings, etc.).

#### **Tools:**
- **show commands (Cisco)**: On Cisco devices, you can use `show running-config` and `show interfaces` commands to view the current configuration and interface status.
  
  ```bash
  show running-config  # Cisco to view configuration
  show interfaces     # Cisco to view interface status
  ```

- **Traceroute**: Use `traceroute` (Linux/macOS) or `tracert` (Windows) to trace the path packets take through the network, helping identify where delays or issues are occurring.

### **5. Check for Bandwidth or Congestion Issues**

Congestion on the network can cause slow performance and intermittent connectivity. This may be caused by a variety of factors, such as high traffic volume or poor-quality network hardware.

#### **Key Checks:**
- **Network Utilization**: Use tools to monitor network traffic and utilization. If a particular device or network segment is congested, consider upgrading hardware or implementing quality-of-service (QoS) policies to prioritize critical traffic.
- **Link Speed and Duplex**: Mismatched speed or duplex settings between devices (e.g., a NIC and switch) can cause performance issues, such as collisions and retransmissions. Ensure that devices are set to auto-negotiate or that matching speed/duplex settings are configured.

#### **Tools:**
- **netstat**: Monitor network connections and bandwidth utilization.
  
  ```bash
  netstat -an
  ```

- **iperf**: Use `iperf` for network bandwidth testing between two devices. This can help measure throughput and identify bandwidth bottlenecks.

### **6. Check for Cable Interference or Faulty Switch Ports**

In some cases, external factors like electromagnetic interference or faulty hardware may affect wired network performance.

#### **Key Checks:**
- **Cable Interference**: Ensure that cables are not running near high-voltage lines or sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can disrupt network signals.
- **Faulty Switch Ports**: Test different switch ports to verify if a specific port is causing issues. Sometimes a switch port can be faulty or go bad.

#### **Tools:**
- **Cable Tester**: Use a cable tester to verify that cables are not defective and can carry the network signal properly.

### **7. Perform a Physical Reset or Reboot**

If all else fails, performing a reset or reboot on network devices may help resolve issues caused by software glitches, memory overload, or incorrect configurations.

#### **Key Checks:**
- **Reboot Devices**: Reboot switches, routers, and computers to clear any temporary issues or memory overload.
- **Factory Reset**: If a device is malfunctioning and no configuration changes seem to resolve the problem, consider performing a factory reset and reconfiguring the device.

---

### **8. Use Diagnostic Tools**

In addition to basic checks, network diagnostic tools can be used for more in-depth troubleshooting.

#### **Key Tools:**
- **Wireshark**: A powerful packet sniffer that can be used to capture and analyze network traffic. It is invaluable for identifying network anomalies and troubleshooting performance issues.
- **tcpdump**: A command-line packet capture tool that can capture traffic in real-time. It’s often used for troubleshooting lower-level issues on a network.

### **Conclusion**

Wired network troubleshooting involves checking the physical connection, verifying configuration settings, ensuring proper device connectivity, and identifying potential network performance issues. By following a structured approach and using the appropriate diagnostic tools, network issues can be quickly identified and resolved, minimizing downtime and improving overall network performance.
