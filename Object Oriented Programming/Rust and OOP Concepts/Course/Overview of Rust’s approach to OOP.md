Rust's approach to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) differs significantly from traditional OOP languages like Java, C++, or Python. Rust incorporates OOP principles but adapts them to fit its design philosophy of safety, performance, and concurrency. Here's an overview:

---

### **1. OOP in Rust: A Different Perspective**
- Rust doesn't have **classes**, a staple of traditional OOP.
- Instead, Rust achieves OOP principles (encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance) using:
  - **Structs** and **Enums** for encapsulating data.
  - **Traits** for defining shared behavior.
  - **Composition** instead of inheritance.

---

### **2. Encapsulation**
- Rust uses **structs** to encapsulate data and provides methods through `impl` blocks.
- Visibility is controlled with the `pub` keyword:
  - Private by default; accessible only within the module.
  - Public members are explicitly declared with `pub`.
- Example:
  ```rust
  pub struct Circle {
      radius: f64,
  }

  impl Circle {
      pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {
          Self { radius }
      }

      pub fn area(&self) -> f64 {
          3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **3. Polymorphism**
- Polymorphism is achieved via **Traits** (Rust's version of interfaces or type classes):
  - Traits define shared behavior.
  - Types implement traits to guarantee specific functionality.
- Static Polymorphism:
  - Implemented at compile time using **generics** and trait bounds.
- Dynamic Polymorphism:
  - Achieved through **trait objects** using `dyn Trait`.
  - Enables runtime dispatch at the cost of performance.

Example:
```rust
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Composition Over Inheritance**
- Rust encourages **composition** rather than classical inheritance.
- Traits and default implementations allow code reuse without creating deep hierarchies.
- Example:
  ```rust
  trait CanFly {
      fn fly(&self) -> String;
  }

  struct Bird;
  impl CanFly for Bird {
      fn fly(&self) -> String {
          "Bird is flying".to_string()
      }
  }

  struct Plane;
  impl CanFly for Plane {
      fn fly(&self) -> String {
          "Plane is flying".to_string()
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **5. Safety and Ownership**
- Rust integrates **ownership** and **lifetimes** into its OOP model to ensure memory safety without garbage collection.
- Shared and exclusive references (`&` and `&mut`) and smart pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`) are used to manage object lifetimes explicitly.

---

### **6. No Inheritance**
- Rust avoids class-based inheritance and prefers **trait-based composition** for extensibility.
- It encourages designing systems with loosely coupled components that interact through traits.

---

### **Key Benefits of Rustâ€™s OOP Model**
1. **Safety First**: Strong guarantees of memory safety and data race prevention.
2. **High Performance**: No runtime overhead for static polymorphism.
3. **Flexibility**: Combines functional and OOP paradigms, offering more design choices.

---

This approach allows Rust to provide powerful tools for designing clean, efficient, and maintainable systems while adhering to its core philosophy.
